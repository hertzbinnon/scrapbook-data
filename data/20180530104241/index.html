      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is one of the most ubiquitous
      and widely adopted application protocols on the Internet: it is the
      common language between clients and servers, enabling the modern web.
      From its simple beginnings as a single keyword and document path, it has
      become the protocol of choice not just for browsers, but for virtually
      every Internet-connected software and hardware application.

      </p><p>In this chapter, we will take a brief historical tour of the evolution
      of the HTTP protocol. A full discussion of the varying HTTP semantics is
      outside the scope of this book, but an understanding of the key design
      changes of HTTP, and the motivations behind each, will give us the
      necessary background for our discussions on HTTP performance, especially
      in the context of the many upcoming improvements in HTTP/2.

      <h2 id="http-09-the-one-line-protocol"><a href="#http-09-the-one-line-protocol" class="anchor">§</a>HTTP 0.9: The
      One-Line Protocol</h2>

      <p>The original HTTP proposal by Tim Berners-Lee was designed with
      <em>simplicity in mind</em> as to help with the adoption of his other
      nascent idea: the World Wide Web. The strategy appears to have worked:
      aspiring protocol designers, take note.

      </p><p>In 1991, Berners-Lee outlined the motivation for the new protocol and
      listed several high-level design goals: file transfer functionality,
      ability to request an index search of a hypertext archive, format
      negotiation, and an ability to refer the client to another server. To
      prove the theory in action, a simple prototype was built, which
      implemented a small subset of the proposed functionality:

      </p><ul>
        <li>
          <p>Client request is a single ASCII character string.

        </p></li><li>
          <p>Client request is terminated by a carriage return (CRLF).

        </p></li><li>
          <p>Server response is an ASCII character stream.
      </p></li></ul>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Server response is a hypertext markup language (HTML).

        </p></li><li>
          <p>Connection is terminated after the document transfer is complete.
      </p></li></ul>

      <p>However, even that sounds a lot more complicated than it really is.
      What these rules enable is an extremely simple, Telnet-friendly protocol,
      which some web servers support to this very day:

      </p><pre data-type="programlisting"><strong>$&gt; telnet google.com 80</strong>

Connected to 74.125.xxx.xxx

GET /about/

(hypertext response)
(connection closed)
</pre>

      <p>The request consists of a single line: <code>GET</code> method and the
      path of the requested document. The response is a single hypertext
      document—no headers or any other metadata, just the HTML. It really
      couldn’t get any simpler. Further, since the previous interaction is a
      subset of the intended protocol, it unofficially acquired the HTTP 0.9
      label. The rest, as they say, is history.

      </p><p>From these humble beginnings in 1991, HTTP took on a life of its own
      and evolved rapidly over the coming years. Let us quickly recap the
      features of HTTP 0.9:

      </p><ul>
        <li>
          <p>Client-server, request-response protocol.

        </p></li><li>
          <p>ASCII protocol, running over a TCP/IP link.

        </p></li><li>
          <p>Designed to transfer hypertext documents (HTML).

        </p></li><li>
          <p>The connection between server and client is closed after every
          request.
      </p></li></ul>

      <div data-type="note" id="id-W5uqHKt8">
        <p>Popular web servers, such as Apache and Nginx, still support the
        HTTP 0.9 protocol—in part, because there is not much to it! If you are
        curious, open up a Telnet session and try accessing google.com, or your
        own favorite site, via HTTP 0.9 and inspect the behavior and the
        limitations of this early protocol.

      <p>The period from 1991 to 1995 is one of rapid coevolution of the HTML
      specification, a new breed of software known as a "web browser," and the
      emergence and quick growth of the consumer-oriented public Internet
      infrastructure.

      </p><aside>
        <h4 id="the-perfect-storm-internet-boom-of-the-early-1990s"><a href="#the-perfect-storm-internet-boom-of-the-early-1990s" class="anchor">§</a>The Perfect Storm: Internet Boom of the Early 1990s</h4>

        <p>Building on Tim Berner-Lee’s initial browser prototype, a team at
        the National Center of Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) decided to
        implement their own version. With that, the first popular browser was
        born: NCSA Mosaic. One of the programmers on the NCSA team, Marc
        Andreessen, partnered with Jim Clark to found Mosaic Communications in
        October 1994. The company was later renamed Netscape, and it shipped
        Netscape Navigator 1.0 in December 1994. By this point, it was already
        clear that the World Wide Web was bound to be <em>much more</em> than
        just an academic curiosity.

        </p><p>In fact, that same year the first World Wide Web conference was
        organized in Geneva, Switzerland, which led to the creation of the
        World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to help guide the evolution of HTML.
        Similarly, a parallel HTTP Working Group (HTTP-WG) was established
        within the IETF to focus on improving the HTTP protocol. Both of these
        groups continue to be instrumental to the evolution of the Web.

        </p><p>Finally, to create the perfect storm, CompuServe, AOL, and Prodigy
        began providing dial-up Internet access to the public within the same
        1994–1995 time frame. Riding on this wave of rapid adoption, Netscape
        made history with a wildly successful IPO on August 9, 1995—the
        Internet boom had arrived, and everyone wanted a piece of it!
      </p></aside>

      <p>The growing list of desired capabilities of the nascent Web and their
      use cases on the public Web quickly exposed many of the fundamental
      limitations of HTTP 0.9: we needed a protocol that could serve more than
      just hypertext documents, provide richer metadata about the request and
      the response, enable content negotiation, and more. In turn, the nascent
      community of web developers responded by producing a large number of
      experimental HTTP server and client implementations through an ad hoc
      process: implement, deploy, and see if other people adopt it.

      </p><p>From this period of rapid experimentation, a set of best practices and
      common patterns began to emerge, and in May 1996 the HTTP Working Group
      (HTTP-WG) published RFC 1945, which documented the "common usage" of the
      many HTTP/1.0 implementations found in the wild. Note that this was only
      an informational RFC: HTTP/1.0 as we know it is not a formal
      specification or an Internet standard!

      </p><p>Having said that, an example HTTP/1.0 request should look very
      familiar:

      </p><div data-type="example" id="-n1unfVCM">
        <pre data-type="programlisting"><strong>$&gt; telnet website.org 80</strong>

            <p>Response status, followed by response headers
        </p></li></ol>
      </div>

      <p>The preceding exchange is not an exhaustive list of HTTP/1.0
      capabilities, but it does illustrate some of the key protocol changes:

      </p><ul>
        <li>
          <p>Request may consist of multiple newline separated header fields.

        </p></li><li>
          <p>Response object is prefixed with a response status line.

        </p></li><li>
          <p>Response object has its own set of newline separated header
          fields.

        </p></li><li>
          <p>Response object is not limited to hypertext.

        </p></li><li>
          <p>The connection between server and client is closed after every
          request.
      </p></li></ul>

      <p>Both the request and response headers were kept as ASCII encoded, but
      the response object itself could be of any type: an HTML file, a plain
      text file, an image, or any other content type. Hence, the "hypertext
      transfer" part of HTTP became a misnomer not long after its introduction.
      In reality, HTTP has quickly evolved to become a <em>hypermedia
      transport</em>, but the original name stuck.

      </p><p>In addition to media type negotiation, the RFC also documented a
      number of other commonly implemented capabilities: content encoding,
      character set support, multi-part types, authorization, caching, proxy
      behaviors, date formats, and more.

      </p><div data-type="note" id="id-wVuwhMC9">
        <p>Almost every server on the Web today can and will still speak
        HTTP/1.0. Except that, by now, you should know better! Requiring a new
        TCP connection per request imposes a significant performance penalty on
        HTTP/1.0; see <a data-type="xref" href="https://hpbn.co/building-blocks-of-tcp/#three-way-handshake">Three-Way Handshake</a>,

    <section>
      <h2 id="http11-internet-standard"><a href="#http11-internet-standard" class="anchor">§</a>HTTP/1.1: Internet Standard</h2>

      <p>The work on turning HTTP into an official IETF Internet standard
      proceeded in parallel with the documentation effort around HTTP/1.0 and
      happened over a period of roughly four years: between 1995 and 1999. In
      fact, the first official HTTP/1.1 standard is defined in RFC 2068, which
      was officially released in January 1997, roughly six months after the
      publication of HTTP/1.0. Then, two and a half years later, in June of
      1999, a number of improvements and updates were incorporated into the
      standard and were released as RFC 2616.

      </p><p>The HTTP/1.1 standard resolved a lot of the protocol ambiguities found
      in earlier versions and introduced a number of critical performance
      optimizations: keepalive connections, chunked encoding transfers,
      byte-range requests, additional caching mechanisms, transfer encodings,
      and request pipelining.

      </p><p>With these capabilities in place, we can now inspect a typical
      HTTP/1.1 session as performed by any modern HTTP browser and client:

      <p>Phew, there is a lot going on in there! The first and most obvious
      difference is that we have two object requests, one for an HTML page and
      one for an image, both delivered over a single connection. This is
      connection keepalive in action, which allows us to reuse the existing TCP
      connection for multiple requests to the same host and deliver a much
      faster end-user experience; see <a data-type="xref" href="https://hpbn.co/building-blocks-of-tcp/#optimizing-for-tcp">Optimizing for TCP</a>.

      </p><p>To terminate the persistent connection, notice that the second client
      request sends an explicit <code>close</code> token to the server via the
      <code>Connection</code> header. Similarly, the server can notify the
      client of the intent to close the current TCP connection once the
      response is transferred. Technically, either side can terminate the TCP
      connection without such signal at any point, but clients and servers
      should provide it whenever possible to enable better connection reuse
      strategies on both sides.

      </p><div data-type="note" id="id-25umUDFY">
        <p>HTTP/1.1 changed the semantics of the HTTP protocol to use
        connection keepalive by default. Meaning, unless told otherwise (via
        <code>Connection: close</code> header), the server should keep the
        connection open by default.

        </p><p>However, this same functionality was also backported to HTTP/1.0 and
        enabled via the <code>Connection: Keep-Alive</code> header. Hence, if
        you are using HTTP/1.1, technically you don’t need the
        <code>Connection: Keep-Alive</code> header, but many clients choose to
        provide it nonetheless.
      </p></div>

      <p>Additionally, the HTTP/1.1 protocol added content, encoding, character
      set, and even language negotiation, transfer encoding, caching
      directives, client cookies, plus a dozen other capabilities that can be
      negotiated on each request.

      </p><p>We are not going to dwell on the semantics of every HTTP/1.1 feature.
      This is a subject for a dedicated book, and many great ones have been
      written already. Instead, the previous example serves as a good
      illustration of both the quick progress and evolution of HTTP, as well as
      the intricate and complicated dance of every client-server exchange.
      There is a lot going on in there!

      applications we have all come to depend on in our lives.

      </p><p>What began as a simple, one-line protocol for retrieving hypertext
      quickly evolved into a generic hypermedia transport, and now a decade
      later can be used to power just about any use case you can imagine. Both
      the ubiquity of servers that can speak the protocol and the wide
      availability of clients to consume it means that many applications are
      now designed and deployed exclusively on top of HTTP.

      </p><p>Need a protocol to control your coffee pot? RFC 2324 has you covered
      with the Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol (HTCPCP/1.0)—originally
      an April Fools’ Day joke by IETF, and increasingly anything but a joke in
      our new hyper-connected world.

      </p><blockquote>
        <p>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level
        protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information
        systems. It is a generic, stateless, protocol that can be used for many
        tasks beyond its use for hypertext, such as name servers and
        distributed object management systems, through extension of its request
        methods, error codes and headers. A feature of HTTP is the typing and
        negotiation of data representation, allowing systems to be built
        independently of the data being transferred.

        </p><p data-type="attribution">RFC 2616: HTTP/1.1, <cite>June 1999</cite>
      </p></blockquote>

      <p>The simplicity of the HTTP protocol is what enabled its original
      adoption and rapid growth. In fact, it is now not unusual to find
      embedded devices—sensors, actuators, and coffee pots alike—using HTTP as
      their primary control and data protocols. But under the weight of its own
      success and as we increasingly continue to migrate our everyday
      interactions to the Web—social, email, news, and video, and increasingly
      our entire personal and job workspaces—it has also begun to show signs of
      stress. Users and web developers alike are now demanding near real-time
      responsiveness and protocol performance from HTTP/1.1, which it simply
      cannot meet without some modifications.

      </p><p>To meet these new challenges, HTTP must continue to evolve, and hence
      the HTTPbis working group announced a new initiative for HTTP/2 in early
      2012:

      </p><blockquote>
        <p>There is emerging implementation experience and interest in a
        protocol that retains the semantics of HTTP without the legacy of
        HTTP/1.x message framing and syntax, which have been identified as
        hampering performance and encouraging misuse of the underlying
        transport.

        </p><p>The working group will produce a specification of a new expression
        of HTTP’s current semantics in ordered, bi-directional streams. As with
        HTTP/1.x, the primary target transport is TCP, but it should be
        possible to use other transports.

        </p><p data-type="attribution">HTTP/2 charter, <cite>January 2012</cite>
      </p></blockquote>

      <p>The primary focus of HTTP/2 is on improving transport performance and
      enabling both lower latency and higher throughput. The major version
      increment sounds like a big step, which it is and will be as far as
      performance is concerned, but it is important to note that none of the
      high-level protocol semantics are affected: all HTTP headers, values, and
      use cases are the same.

      </p><p>Any existing website or application can and will be delivered over
      HTTP/2 without modification: you do not need to modify your application
      markup to take advantage of HTTP/2. The HTTP servers will have to speak
      HTTP/2, but that should be a transparent upgrade for the majority of
      users. The only difference if the working group meets its goal, should be
      that our applications are delivered with lower latency and better
      utilization of the network link!

      </p><p>Having said that, let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Before we get to
      the new HTTP/2 protocol features, it is worth taking a step back and
      examining our existing deployment and performance best practices for
      HTTP/1.1. The HTTP/2 working group is making fast progress on the new
      specification, but even if the final standard was already done and ready,
      we would still have to support older HTTP/1.1 clients for the foreseeable
      future—realistically, a decade or more.
