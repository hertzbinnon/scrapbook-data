      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>A modern browser is a platform specifically designed for fast,
      efficient, and secure delivery of web applications. In fact, under the
      hood, a modern browser is an entire operating system with hundreds of
      components: process management, security sandboxes, layers of
      optimization caches, JavaScript VMs, graphics rendering and GPU
      pipelines, storage, sensors, audio and video, networking, and much more.

      </p><p>Not surprisingly, the overall performance of the browser, and any
      application that it runs, is determined by a number of components:
      parsing, layout, style calculation of HTML and CSS, JavaScript execution
      speed, rendering pipelines, and of course the networking stack. Each
      component plays a critical role, but networking often doubly so, since if
      the browser is blocked on the network, waiting for the resources to
      arrive, then all other steps are blocked!

      </p><p>As a result, it is not surprising to discover that the networking
      stack of a modern browser is much more than a simple socket manager. From
      the outside, it may present itself as a simple resource-fetching
      mechanism, but from the inside it is its own platform (<a data-type="xref" href="#browser-networking">Figure&nbsp;14-1</a>), with its own
      optimization criteria, APIs, and services.

      </p><figure id="browser-networking">

      <p>When designing a web application, we don’t have to worry about the
      individual TCP or UDP sockets; the browser manages that for us. Further,
      the network stack takes care of imposing the right connection limits,
      formatting our requests, sandboxing individual applications from one
      another, dealing with proxies, caching, and much more. In turn, with all
      of this complexity removed, our applications can focus on the application
      logic.

      </p><p>However, out of sight does not mean out of mind! As we saw,
      understanding the performance characteristics of TCP, HTTP, and mobile
      networks can help us build faster applications. Similarly, understanding
      how to optimize for the various browser networking APIs, protocols, and
      services can make a dramatic difference in performance of any
      application.

    <section>
      <h2 id="connection-management-and-optimization"><a href="#connection-management-and-optimization" class="anchor">§</a>Connection
      Management and Optimization</h2>

      <p>Web applications running in the browser do not manage the lifecycle of
      individual network sockets, and that’s a good thing. By deferring this
      work to the browser, we allow it to automate a number of critical
      performance optimizations, such as socket reuse, request prioritization
      and late binding, protocol negotiation, enforcing connection limits, and
      much more. In fact, the browser intentionally separates the <em>request
      management</em> lifecycle from <em>socket management</em>. This is a
      subtle but critical distinction.

      </p><p>Sockets are organized in pools (<a data-type="xref" href="#socket-pools">Figure&nbsp;14-2</a>), which are grouped by origin, and
      each pool enforces its own connection limits and security constraints.
      Pending requests are queued, prioritized, and then bound to individual
      sockets in the pool. Consequently, unless the server intentionally closes
      the connection, the same socket can be automatically reused across
      multiple requests!

      </p><figure id="socket-pools">
        <img src="1d7d7e4dc5954b7ee5beb4312a660849.svg" alt="Figure 14-2. Auto-managed socket pools are shared among all browser processes">

        <figcaption>
          <span class="label">Figure 14-2.</span> Auto-managed socket pools are
          shared among all browser processes
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <dl>
        <dt>Origin

        </dt><dd>
          <p>A triple of application protocol, domain name, and port
          number—e.g., (http, www.example.com, 80) and (https, www.example.com,
          443) are considered as different origins.

        </p></dd><dt>Socket pool

        </dt><dd>
          <p>A group of sockets belonging to the same origin. In practice, all
          major browsers limit the maximum pool size to six sockets.
      </p></dd></dl>

      <p>Automatic socket pooling automates TCP connection reuse, which offers
      significant performance benefits; see <a data-type="xref" href="https://hpbn.co/http1x/#benefits-of-keepalive-connections">Benefits of Keepalive
      Connections</a>. However, that’s not all. This architecture also enables
      a number of additional optimization opportunities:

      </p><ul>
        <li>
          <p>The browser can service queued requests in priority order.

        </p></li><li>
          <p>The browser can reuse sockets to minimize latency and improve
          throughput.

        </p></li><li>
          <p>The browser can be proactive in opening sockets in anticipation of
          request.

        </p></li><li>
          <p>The browser can optimize when idle sockets are closed.

        </p></li><li>
          <p>The browser can optimize bandwidth allocation across all sockets.
      </p></li></ul>

      <p>In short, the browser networking stack is our strategic ally on our
      quest to deliver high-performance applications. None of the functionality
      we have covered requires any work on our behalf! However, that’s not to
      say that we can’t help the browser. Design decisions in our applications
      that determine the network communication patterns, type and frequency of
      transfers, choice of protocols, and tuning and optimization of our server
      stacks play critical roles in the end performance of every application.

        <p>We have already established that the network stack of a modern
        browser is much more than a simple socket manager. However, even that
        does not do full justice to some of the optimization techniques
        performed by modern browsers.

        </p><p>For example, Google Chrome browser gets faster as you use it. Chrome
        learns the topology of visited sites and typical browsing patterns and
        then leverages this information to perform a variety of "speculative
        optimizations" designed to anticipate likely user actions and eliminate
        unnecessary network latency: DNS pre-resolving, TCP pre-connect, page
        pre-rendering, and more. Simple actions, such as a mouse hover over a
        link can trigger a signal from the browser to the network stack
        "predictor," which may then select the best optimization based on past
        performance data!

        </p><p>For more details, see our earlier discussion on <a data-type="xref" href="https://hpbn.co/primer-on-web-performance/#browser-optimization">Browser
        Optimization</a>. And if you’re curious to learn more about Chrome’s

      <h2 id="network-security-and-sandboxing"><a href="#network-security-and-sandboxing" class="anchor">§</a>Network Security
      and Sandboxing</h2>

      <p>Deferring management of individual sockets serves another important
      purpose: it allows the browser to sandbox and enforce a consistent set of
      security and policy constraints on untrusted application code. For
      example, the browser does not permit direct API access to raw network
      sockets, as that would allow a malicious application to initiate
      arbitrary connections to any host—e.g., run a port scan, connect to a
      mail server and start sending unintended messages, and so on.

      </p><dl>
        <dt>Connection limits

        </dt><dd>
          <p>Browser manages all open socket pools and enforces connection
          limits to protect both the client and server from resource
          exhaustion.

        </p></dd><dt>Request formatting and response processing

        </dt><dd>
          <p>Browser formats all outgoing requests to enforce consistent and
          well-formed protocol semantics to protect the server. Similarly,
          response decoding is done automatically to protect the user from
          malicious servers.

        </p></dd><dt>TLS negotiation

        </dt><dd>
          <p>Browser performs the TLS handshake and performs the necessary
          verification checks of the certificates. The user is warned when and
          if any of the verification fails—e.g., server is using a self-signed
          certificate.

        </p></dd><dt>Same-origin policy

        </dt><dd>
          <p>Browser enforces constraints on which requests can be initiated by
          the application and to which origin.
      </p></dd></dl>

      <p>The previous list is not complete, but it highlights the principle of
      "least privilege" at work. The browser exposes only the APIs and
      resources that are necessary for the application code: the application
      supplies the data and URL, and the browser formats the request and
      handles the full lifecycle of each connection.

      </p><div data-type="note" id="id-e3COI6TV">
        <p>It is worth noting that there is no single "same-origin policy."
        Instead, there is a set of related mechanisms that enforce restrictions
        on DOM access, cookie and session state management, networking, and
        other components of the browser.

        </p><p>A full discussion on browser security requires its own separate
        book. If you are curious, Michal Zalewski’s <em>The Tangled Web: A
        Guide to Securing Modern Web Applications</em> is a fantastic resource.

    <section>
      <h2 id="resource-and-client-state-caching"><a href="#resource-and-client-state-caching" class="anchor">§</a>Resource and
      Client State Caching</h2>

      <p>The best and fastest request is a request not made. Prior to
      dispatching a request, the browser automatically checks its resource
      cache, performs the necessary validation checks, and returns a local copy
      of the resources if the specified constraints are satisfied. Similarly,
      if a local resource is not available in cache, then a network request is
      made and the response is automatically placed in cache for subsequent
      access if permitted.

      </p><ul>
        <li>
          <p>The browser automatically evaluates caching directives on each
          resource.

        </p></li><li>
          <p>The browser automatically revalidates expired resources when
          possible.

        </p></li><li>
          <p>The browser automatically manages the size of cache and resource
          eviction.
      </p></li></ul>

      <p>Managing an efficient and optimized resource cache is hard.
      Thankfully, the browser takes care of all of the complexity on our
      behalf, and all we need to do is ensure that our servers are returning
      the appropriate cache directives; see <a data-type="xref" href="https://hpbn.co/optimizing-application-delivery/#cache-resources-on-the-client">Cache
      Resources on the Client</a>. You are providing Cache-Control, ETag, and
      Last-Modified response headers for all the resources on your pages,
      right?

      </p><p>Finally, an often-overlooked but critical function of the browser is
      to provide authentication, session, and cookie management. The browser
      maintains separate "cookie jars" for each origin, provides necessary
      application and server APIs to read and write new cookie, session, and
      authentication data and automatically appends and processes appropriate
      HTTP headers to automate the entire process on our behalf.

      </p><div data-type="note" id="id-pLC0FrCL">
        <p>A simple but illustrative example of the convenience of deferring
        session state management to the browser: an authenticated session can
        be shared across multiple tabs or browser windows, and vice versa; a
        sign-out action in a single tab will invalidate open sessions in all
        other open windows.
      </p></div>

    <section>
      <h2 id="application-apis-and-protocols"><a href="#application-apis-and-protocols" class="anchor">§</a>Application APIs
      and Protocols</h2>

      <p>Walking up the ladder of provided network services we finally arrive
      at the application APIs and protocols. As we saw, the lower layers
      provide a wide array of critical services: socket and connection
      management, request and response processing, enforcement of various
      security policies, caching, and much more. Every time we initiate an HTTP
      or an XMLHttpRequest, a long-lived Server-Sent Events or WebSocket
      session, or open a WebRTC connection, we are interacting with some or all
      of these underlying services.

      </p><p>There is no one best protocol or API. Every nontrivial application
      will require a mix of different transports based on a variety of
      requirements: interaction with the browser cache, protocol overhead,
      message latency, reliability, type of data transfer, and more. Some
      protocols may offer low-latency delivery (e.g., Server-Sent Events,
      WebSocket), but may not meet other critical criteria, such as the ability
      to leverage the browser cache or support efficient binary transfers in
      all cases.

      applications, can make all the difference between a high-performance
      application and a consistently poor experience for the user.
