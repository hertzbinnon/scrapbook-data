  </p></header>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>WiFi operates in the unlicensed ISM spectrum; it is trivial to deploy
      by anyone, anywhere; and the required hardware is simple and cheap. Not
      surprisingly, it has become one of the most widely deployed and popular
      wireless standards.

      </p><p>The name itself is a trademark of the WiFi Alliance, which is a trade
      association established to promote wireless LAN technologies, as well as
      to provide interoperability standards and testing. Technically, a device
      must be submitted to and certified by the WiFi Alliance to carry the WiFi
      name and logo, but in practice, the name is used to refer to any product
      based on the IEEE 802.11 standards.

      </p><p>The first 802.11 protocol was drafted in 1997, more or less as a
      direct adaptation of the Ethernet standard (IEEE 802.3) to the world of
      wireless communication. However, it wasn’t until 1999, when the 802.11b
      standard was introduced, that the market for WiFi devices took off. The
      relative simplicity of the technology, easy deployment, convenience, and
      the fact that it operated in the unlicensed 2.4 GHz ISM band allowed
      anyone to easily provide a "wireless extension" to their existing local
      area network. Today, most every new desktop, laptop, tablet, smartphone,
      and just about every other form-factor device is WiFi enabled.

    <section>
      <h2 id="from-ethernet-to-a-wireless-lan"><a href="#from-ethernet-to-a-wireless-lan" class="anchor">§</a>From Ethernet to a
      Wireless LAN</h2>

      <p>The 802.11 wireless standards were primarily designed as an adaptation
      and an extension of the existing Ethernet (802.3) standard. Hence, while
      Ethernet is commonly referred to as the LAN standard, the 802.11 family
      (<a data-type="xref" href="#wifi-osi">Figure&nbsp;6-1</a>) is
      correspondingly commonly known as the wireless LAN (WLAN). However, for
      the history geeks, technically much of the Ethernet protocol was inspired
      by the ALOHAnet protocol, which was the first public demonstration of a
      wireless network developed in 1971 at the University of Hawaii. In other
      words, we have come full circle.

      </p><figure id="wifi-osi">
        <img src="f5a120c8182ae808792b8ad40b03a84d.svg" alt="Figure 6-1. 802.3 (Ethernet) and 802.11 (WiFi) data and physical layers">

        <figcaption>
          <span class="label">Figure 6-1.</span> 802.3 (Ethernet) and 802.11
          (WiFi) data and physical layers
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>The reason why this distinction is important is due to the mechanics
      of how the ALOHAnet, and consequently Ethernet and WiFi protocols,
      schedule all communication. Namely, they all treat the shared medium,
      regardless of whether it is a wire or the radio waves, as a "random
      access channel," which means that there is no central process, or
      scheduler, that controls who or which device is allowed to transmit data
      at any point in time. Instead, each device decides on its own, and all
      devices must work together to guarantee good shared channel performance.

      </p><p>The Ethernet standard has historically relied on a probabilistic
      carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) protocol, which is a complicated
      name for a simple "listen before you speak" algorithm. In brief, if you
      have data to send:

      </p><ul>
        <li>
          <p>Check whether anyone else is transmitting.

        </p></li><li>
          <p>If the channel is busy, listen until it is free.

        </p></li><li>
          <p>When the channel is free, transmit data immediately.
      </p></li></ul>

      <p>Of course, it takes time to propagate any signal; hence collisions can
      still occur. For this reason, the Ethernet standard also added collision
      detection (CSMA/CD): if a collision is detected, then both parties stop
      transmitting immediately and sleep for a random interval (with
      exponential backoff). This way, multiple competing senders won’t
      synchronize and restart their transmissions simultaneously.

      </p><p>WiFi follows a very similar but slightly different model: due to
      hardware limitations of the radio, it cannot detect collisions while
      sending data. Hence, WiFi relies on collision avoidance (CSMA/CA), where
      each sender attempts to avoid collisions by transmitting only when the
      channel is sensed to be idle, and then sends its full message frame in
      its entirety. Once the WiFi frame is sent, the sender waits for an
      explicit acknowledgment from the receiver before proceeding with the next
      transmission.

      </p><p>There are a few more details, but in a nutshell that’s all there is to
      it: the combination of these techniques is how both Ethernet and WiFi
      regulate access to the shared medium. In the case of Ethernet, the medium
      is a physical wire, and in the case of WiFi, it is the shared radio
      channel.

      </p><p>In practice, the probabilistic access model works very well for
      lightly loaded networks. In fact, we won’t show the math here, but we can
      prove that to get good channel utilization (minimize number of
      collisions), the channel load must be kept below 10%. If the load is kept
      low, we can get good throughput without any explicit coordination or
      scheduling. However, if the load increases, then the number of collisions
      will quickly rise, leading to unstable performance of the entire network.

      </p><div data-type="note" id="id-mJtpFQU6">
        <p>If you have ever tried to use a highly loaded WiFi network, with
        many peers competing for access—say, at a large public event, like a
        conference hall—then chances are, you have firsthand experience with
        "unstable WiFi performance." Of course, the probabilistic scheduling is
        not the only factor, but it certainly plays a role.

      <p>The 802.11b standard launched WiFi into everyday use, but as with any
      popular technology, the IEEE 802 Standards Committee has not been idle
      and has actively continued to release new protocols (<a data-type="xref" href="#wifi-releases">Table&nbsp;6-1</a>) with higher throughput, better
      modulation techniques, multistreaming, and many other new features.

      <p>Today, the "b" and "g" standards are the most widely deployed and
      supported. Both utilize the unlicensed 2.4 GHz ISM band, use 20 MHz of
      bandwidth, and support at most one radio data stream. Depending on your
      local regulations, the transmit power is also likely fixed at a maximum
      of 200 mW. Some routers will allow you to adjust this value but will
      likely override it with a regional maximum.

      </p><p>So how do we increase performance of our future WiFi networks? The "n"
      and upcoming "ac" standards are doubling the bandwidth from 20 to 40 MHz
      per channel, using higher-order modulation, and adding multiple radios to
      transmit multiple streams in parallel—multiple-input and multiple-output
      (MIMO). All combined, and in ideal conditions, this should enable
      gigabit-plus throughput with the upcoming "ac" wireless standard.
    </p></section>

    <section>
      <h2 id="measuring-and-optimizing-wifi-performance"><a href="#measuring-and-optimizing-wifi-performance" class="anchor">§</a>Measuring and Optimizing WiFi Performance</h2>

      <p>By this point you should be skeptical of the notion of "ideal
      conditions," and for good reason. The wide adoption and popularity of
      WiFi networks also created one of its biggest performance challenges:
      inter- and intra-cell interference. The WiFi standard does not have any
      central scheduler, which also means that there are no guarantees on
      throughput or latency for any client.

      </p><p>The new WiFi Multimedia (WMM) extension enables basic Quality of
      Service (QoS) within the radio interface for latency-sensitive
      applications (e.g., voice, video, best effort), but few routers, and even
      fewer deployed clients, are aware of it. In the meantime, all traffic
      both within your own network, and in nearby WiFi networks must compete
      for access for the same shared radio resource.

      </p><p>Your router may allow you to set some Quality of Service (QoS) policy
      for clients within your own network (e.g., maximum total data rate per
      client, or by type of traffic), but you nonetheless have no control over
      traffic generated by other, nearby WiFi networks. The fact that WiFi
      networks are so easy to deploy is what made them ubiquitous, but the
      widespread adoption has also created a lot of performance problems: in
      practice it is now not unusual to find several dozen different and
      overlapping WiFi networks (<a data-type="xref" href="#ig-wifi">Figure&nbsp;6-2</a>) in any high-density urban or office
      environment.

      </p><figure id="ig-wifi">
        <img src="d754c6b39cccff80641b0030f9f59759.png" alt="Figure 6-2. inSSIDer visualization of overlapping WiFi networks (2.4 and 5 GHz bands)">

          <span class="label">Figure 6-2.</span> inSSIDer visualization of
          overlapping WiFi networks (2.4 and 5 GHz bands)
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>The most widely used 2.4 GHz band provides three non-overlapping 20
      MHz radio channels: 1, 6, and 11 (<a data-type="xref" href="#wifi-channels">Figure&nbsp;6-3</a>). Although even this assignment is
      not consistent among all countries. In some, you may be allowed to use
      higher channels (13, 14), and in others you may be effectively limited to
      an even smaller subset. However, regardless of local regulations, what
      this effectively means is that the moment you have more than two or three
      nearby WiFi networks, some must overlap and hence compete for the same
      shared bandwidth in the same frequency ranges.

      </p><figure id="wifi-channels">
        <img src="7791d95cced297a18105e4c33c4622a1.svg" alt="Figure 6-3. Wikipedia illustration of WiFi channels in the 2.4 GHz band">

          channels in the 2.4 GHz band
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>Your 802.11g client and router may be capable of reaching 54 Mbps, but
      the moment your neighbor, who is occupying the same WiFi channel, starts
      streaming an HD video over WiFi, your bandwidth is cut in half, or worse.
      Your access point has no say in this arrangement, and that is a feature,
      not a bug!

      </p><p>Unfortunately, latency performance fares no better. There are no
      guarantees for the latency of the first hop between your client and the
      WiFi access point. In environments with many overlapping networks, you
      should not be surprised to see high variability, measured in tens and
      even hundreds of milliseconds for the first wireless hop. You are
      competing for access to a shared channel with every other wireless peer.

      </p><p>The good news is, if you are an early adopter, then there is a good
      chance that you can significantly improve performance of your own WiFi
      network. The 5 GHz band, used by the new 802.11n and 802.11ac standards,
      offers both a much wider frequency range and is still largely
      interference free in most environments. That is, at least for the moment,
      and assuming you don’t have too many tech-savvy friends nearby, like
      yourself! A dual-band router, which is capable of transmitting both on
      the 2.4 GHz and the 5 GHz bands will likely offer the best of both
      worlds: compatibility with old clients limited to 2.4 GHz, and much
      better performance for any client on the 5 GHz band.

        <p>Running a ping to your wireless gateway is a simple way to estimate
        the latency of your first wireless hop. Your results <em>will</em> be

      </p></aside>

      <p>Putting it all together, what does this tell us about the performance
      of WiFi?

      </p><ul>
        <li>
          <p>WiFi provides no bandwidth or latency guarantees or assignment to
          its users.

        </p></li><li>
          <p>WiFi provides variable bandwidth based on signal-to-noise in its
          environment.

        </p></li><li>
          <p>WiFi transmit power is limited to 200 mW, and likely less in your
          region.

        </p></li><li>
          <p>WiFi has a limited amount of spectrum in 2.4 GHz and the newer 5
          GHz bands.

        </p></li><li>
          <p>WiFi access points overlap in their channel assignment by design.

        </p></li><li>
          <p>WiFi access points and peers compete for access to the same radio
          channel.
      </p></li></ul>

      <p>There is no such thing as "typical" WiFi performance. The operating
      range will vary based on the standard, location of the user, used
      devices, and the local radio environment. If you are lucky, and you are
      the only WiFi user, then you can expect high throughput, low latency, and
      low variability in both. But once you are competing for access with other
      peers, or nearby WiFi networks, then all bets are off—expect high
      variability for latency and bandwidth.

        Networks</h3>

        <p>The probabilistic scheduling of WiFi transmissions can result in a
        high number of collisions between multiple wireless peers in the area.
        However, even if that is the case, this does not necessarily translate
        to higher amounts of observed TCP packet loss. The data and physical
        layer implementations of all WiFi protocols have their own
        retransmission and error correction mechanisms, which hide these
        wireless collisions from higher layers of the networking stack.

        </p><p>In other words, while TCP packet loss is definitely a concern for
        data delivered over WiFi, the absolute rate observed by TCP is often no
        higher than that of most wired networks. Instead of direct TCP packet
        loss, you are much more likely to see higher variability in packet
        arrival times due to the underlying collisions and retransmissions
        performed by the lower link and physical layers.

          <p>Prior to 802.11n, the WiFi protocol allowed at most one in-flight
          frame at any point in time, which had to be ACKed by the link layer
          before the next frame is sent. With 802.11n, a new "frame
          aggregation" feature was introduced, which allows multiple WiFi
          frames to be sent and ACKed at once.

      Networks</h2>

      <p>The preceding performance characteristics of WiFi may paint an overly
      stark picture against it. In practice, it seems to work "well enough" in
      most cases, and the simple convenience that WiFi enables is hard to beat.
      In fact, you are now more likely to have a device that requires an extra
      peripheral to get an Ethernet jack for a wired connection than to find a
      computer, smartphone, or tablet that is not WiFi enabled.

      </p><p>With that in mind, it is worth considering whether your application
      can benefit from knowing about and optimizing for WiFi networks.

        Bandwidth</h3>

        <p>In practice, a WiFi network is usually an extension to a wired LAN,
        which is in turn connected via DSL, cable, or fiber to the wide area
        network. For an average user in the U.S., this translates to 8.6 Mbps
        of edge bandwidth and a 3.1 Mbps global average (<a data-type="xref" href="https://hpbn.co/primer-on-latency-and-bandwidth/#global-bandwidth-table">Table&nbsp;1-2</a>).
        In other words, most WiFi clients are still likely to be limited by the
        available WAN bandwidth, not by WiFi itself. That is, when the "radio
        network weather" is nice!

        </p><p>However, bandwidth bottlenecks aside, this also frequently means
        that a typical WiFi deployment is backed by an unmetered WAN
        connection—or, at the very least, a connection with much higher data
        caps and maximum throughput. While many users may be sensitive to large
        downloads over their 3G or 4G connections due to associated costs and
        bandwidth caps, frequently this is not as much of a concern when on
        WiFi.

        </p><p>Of course, the unmetered assumption is not true in all cases (e.g.,
        a WiFi tethered device backed by a 3G or 4G connection), but in
        practice it holds true more often than not. Consequently, large
        downloads, updates, and streaming use cases are best done over WiFi
        when possible. Don’t be afraid to prompt the user to switch to WiFi on
        such occasions!

        </p><div data-type="note" id="id-mJtMUwTysO">
          <p>Many mobile carriers recommend "Wi-Fi offloading" as an explicit
          strategy for data-intensive applications: prompt the user to switch
          to WiFi, or leverage WiFi connectivity whenever possible to perform
          your background syncs and large data transfers.

        Bandwidth</h3>

        <p>As we saw, WiFi provides no bandwidth or latency guarantees. The
        user’s router may have some application-level QoS policies, which may
        provide a degree of fairness to multiple peers on the same wireless
        network. However, the WiFi radio interface itself has very limited
        support for QoS. Worse, there are no QoS policies between multiple,
        overlapping WiFi networks.

        </p><p>As a result, the available bandwidth allocation may change
        dramatically, on a second-to-second basis, based on small changes in
        location, activity of nearby wireless peers, and the general radio
        environment.

        </p><p>As an example, an HD video stream may require several megabits per
        second of bandwidth (<a data-type="xref" href="#youtube-bitrate">Table&nbsp;6-3</a>), and while most WiFi standards
        are sufficient in ideal conditions, in practice you should not be
        surprised to see, and should anticipate, intermittent drops in
        throughput. In fact, due to the dynamic nature of available bandwidth,
        you cannot and should not extrapolate past download bitrate too far
        into the future. Testing for bandwidth rate just at the beginning of
        the video will likely result in intermittent buffering pauses as the
        radio conditions change during playback.

        <p>Instead, while we can’t predict the available bandwidth, we can and
        should adapt based on continuous measurement through techniques such as
        adaptive bitrate streaming.

        </p><aside>
          <h4 id="adaptive-bitrate-streaming"><a href="#adaptive-bitrate-streaming" class="anchor">§</a>Adaptive Bitrate
          Streaming</h4>

          <p>While adaptive bitrate streaming is not applicable to all resource
          types, it is a perfect match for long-lived streams such as video and
          audio content.

          </p><p>In the case of video, the resource may be encoded and stored at
          multiple bitrates and then segmented into many parts (e.g., 5–10
          second chunks for YouTube videos). Then, while the client is
          streaming the data, either the client or the server can monitor the
          download rate of each segment and dynamically switch the bitrate of
          the next segment to adjust for the varying bandwidth. In fact, in
          practice many video streaming services begin the stream with a low
          bitrate segment to get fast playback start and then continuously
          adjust the bitrate of the following segments based on the available
          bandwidth.

          </p><p>How many different bitrate levels do you need? The answer depends
          on your application! But as an example, Netflix encodes each and
          every stream in over 120 different versions to adjust for the varying
          screen sizes and available bandwidth bitrates. Delivering a smooth,
          on-demand video experience is not a trivial exercise.

        <h3 id="adapt-to-variable-latency"><a href="#adapt-to-variable-latency" class="anchor">§</a>Adapt to Variable Latency</h3>

        <p>Just as there are no bandwidth guarantees when on WiFi, similarly,
        there are no guarantees on the latency of the first wireless hop.
        Further, things get only more unpredictable if multiple wireless hops
        are needed, such as in the case when a wireless bridge (relay) access
        point is used.

        </p><p>In the ideal case, when there is minimum interference and the
        network is not loaded, the wireless hop can take less than one
        millisecond with very low variability. However, in practice, in
        high-density urban and office environments the presence of dozens of
        competing WiFi access points and peers creates a lot of contention for
        the same radio frequencies. As a result, you should not be surprised to
        see a 1–10 millisecond median for the first wireless hop, with a long
        latency tail: expect an occasional 10–50 millisecond delay and, in the
        worst case, even as high as hundreds of milliseconds.

        </p><p>If your application is latency sensitive, then you may need to think
        carefully about adapting its behavior when running over a WiFi network.
        In fact, this may be a good reason to consider WebRTC, which offers the
        option of an unreliable UDP transport. Of course, switching transports
        won’t fix the radio network, but it can help lower the protocol and
        application induced latency overhead.
