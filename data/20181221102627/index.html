<p>
Most modern operating systems are designed to try to extract optimal performance
from underlying hardware resources. This is achieved mainly by
virtualization of the two main hardware resources: CPU and memory.
Modern operating systems provide a multitasking environment that essentially
gives each task its own virtual CPU.
The task generally is unaware of the fact that it does not have exclusive
use of the CPU.
</p><p>
Similarly, memory virtualization is achieved by giving each task its own
virtual memory address space, which is then mapped onto the real memory of the system.
Again, the task generally is unaware of the fact that its virtual memory addresses
may not map to the same physical address in real memory.
</p>

<p>
CPU virtualization is achieved by “sharing” the CPU
between multiple tasks—that is, each running task gets a small fraction of the
CPU at regular intervals.
The algorithm used to select one task at a time from the multiple available
runnable tasks is called the scheduler, and the process of selecting the next
task is called scheduling.
</p><p>
The scheduler is one of the most important
components of any OS.
Implementing a scheduling algorithm is difficult for a couple reasons.
First, an acceptable algorithm has to
allocate CPU time such that higher-priority tasks (for example, interactive
applications like a Web browser) are given preference over low-priority
tasks (for example, non-interactive batch processes like program compilation).
At the same time, the scheduler must protect against low-priority process
starvation. In other words, low-priority processes must be
allowed to run eventually, regardless of how many high-priority processes are vying
for CPU time. Schedulers also must be crafted carefully, so that processes appear to be
running simultaneously without having too large an impact on system
throughput.
</p><p>
For interactive processes like GUIs, the ideal scheduler would
give each process a very small amount of time on the CPU and rapidly cycle
between processes.
Because users expect interactive processes to respond to input immediately,
the delay between user input and process execution ideally should be
imperceptible to humans—somewhere between 50 and 150ms at most.
</p><p>
For non-interactive processes, the situation is reversed. Switching between
processes, or context switching, is a relatively expensive operation. Thus,
larger slices of time on the processor and fewer context switches can
improve system performance and throughput. The scheduling algorithm must
strike a balance between all of these competing needs.
</p><p>
Like most modern operating systems, Linux is a multitasking operating
system, and therefore, it has a scheduler.
The Linux scheduler has evolved over time.
</p></div><div xml:lang="en" lang="en"><div><a></a>
O(1) Scheduler</div><p>
The Linux scheduler was overhauled completely with the release of kernel 2.6.
This new scheduler is called the O(1) scheduler—O(...) is referred to
as “big O notation”.
The name was chosen because the scheduler's algorithm required constant time
to make a scheduling decision, regardless of the number of tasks.
The algorithm used by the O(1) scheduler relies on active and expired arrays
of processes to achieve constant scheduling time. Each process is given a
fixed time quantum, after which it is preempted and moved to the
expired array. Once all the tasks from the active array have exhausted
their time quantum and have been moved to the expired array, an array switch
takes place. This switch makes the active array the new
empty expired array, while the expired array becomes the active array.
</p><p>
The main issue with this algorithm is the complex heuristics used to mark
a task as interactive or non-interactive. The algorithm tries to identify
interactive processes by analyzing average sleep time (the amount of time
the process spends waiting for input). Processes that sleep for long
periods of time probably are waiting for user input, so the scheduler
assumes they're interactive. The scheduler gives a priority bonus to
interactive tasks (for better throughput) while penalizing non-interactive
tasks by lowering their priorities. All the calculations to determine the
interactivity of tasks are complex and subject to potential
miscalculations, causing non-interactive behavior from an interactive process.
</p><p>
As I explain later in this article, CFS is free from any such
calculations and just tries to be “fair” to every task running in
the system.
</p></div><div xml:lang="en" lang="en"><div><a></a>
Completely Fair Scheduler</div><p>
According to Ingo Molnar, the author of the CFS, its core design can
be summed up in single sentence: “CFS basically models an 'ideal, precise
multitasking CPU' on real hardware.”
</p><p>
Let's try to understand what “ideal, precise, multitasking CPU” means,
as the CFS
tries to emulate this CPU. An “ideal, precise, multitasking
CPU”
is a hardware CPU that can run multiple processes at the same time (in
parallel), giving each process an equal share of processor power (not time, but power).
If a single process is running, it would receive 100% of the processor's
power. With two processes, each would have exactly 50% of the physical
power (in parallel). Similarly, with four processes running, each would get
precisely 25% of physical CPU power in parallel and so on. Therefore, this
CPU would be “fair” to all the tasks running in the system
(Figure 1).
</p><div><a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/files/linuxjournal.com/linuxjournal/articles/102/10267/10267f1.jpg"><img src="10267f1.inline.jpg"></a><div><p>
Figure 1. Ideal, Precise, Multitasking CPU
</p></div></div><p>
Obviously, this ideal CPU is nonexistent, but the CFS tries to
emulate such a processor in software. On an actual real-world
processor, only one task can be allocated to a CPU at a particular time.
Therefore, all other tasks wait during this period. So, while the
currently running task gets 100% of the CPU power, all other tasks get 0%
of the CPU power. This is obviously not fair (Figure 2).
</p><div><a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/files/linuxjournal.com/linuxjournal/articles/102/10267/10267f2.jpg"><img src="10267f2.inline.jpg"></a><div><p>
Figure 2. Actual Hardware CPU
</p></div></div><p>
The CFS tries to eliminate this unfairness from
the system. The CFS tries
to keep track of the fair share of the CPU that would have been
available to each process in the system. So, CFS runs a fair clock
at a fraction of real CPU clock speed. The fair
clock's rate of increase is calculated by dividing the wall time (in
nanoseconds) by the total
number of processes waiting. The resulting value is the amount of CPU time
to which each process is entitled.
</p><p>
As a process waits for the CPU, the scheduler
tracks the amount of time it would have used on the ideal processor. This
wait time, represented by the per-task wait_runtime variable, is used to rank
processes for scheduling and to determine the amount of time the process is
allowed to execute before being preempted. The process with the longest
wait time (that is, with the gravest need of CPU) is picked by the scheduler
and assigned to the CPU. When this process is running, its wait time
decreases, while the time of other waiting tasks increases (as they were
waiting). This essentially means that after some time, there will be
another task with the largest wait time (in gravest need of the CPU), and
the currently running task will be preempted. Using this principle,
CFS tries to be fair to all tasks and always tries to have a
system with zero wait time for each process—each process has an equal
share of the CPU (something an “ideal, precise, multitasking CPU”
would have done).
</p></div>

<div xml:lang="en" lang="en"><div><a></a>
Kernel 2.6.23</div><p>
In order for the CFS to emulate an “ideal, precise,
multitasking CPU” by giving each runnable process an equal slice of
execution time, CFS needs to have the following:
</p><div><ol type="1"><li><p>
A mechanism to calculate what the fair CPU share is per
process. This is achieved by using a system-wide runqueue fair_clock
variable (cfs_rq-&gt;fair_clock). This fair clock runs at a fraction of real
time, so that it runs at the ideal pace for a single task when there are N
runnable tasks in the system. For example, if you have four runnable tasks,
fair_clock increases at one-fourth of the speed of wall time
(which means 25% fair CPU power).
</p></li><li><p>
A mechanism to keep track of the time for which each process was waiting
while the CPU was assigned to the currently running task. This wait time is
accumulated in the per-process variable wait_runtime (process-&gt;wait_runtime).
</p></li></ol></div></div><div xml:lang="en" lang="en"><div><a></a></div><div><p><b>
Red-Black Tree (RBTree)</b></p><p>
A red-black tree is a type of self-balancing binary search tree—a data
structure typically used to implement associative arrays. It is complex,
but it has good worst-case running time for its operations and is efficient in
practice. It can search, insert and delete in O(log n) time, where n is
the number of elements in the tree. In red-black trees, the leaf nodes are
not relevant and do not contain data. These leaves need not be explicit in
computer memory—a null child pointer can encode the fact that this child
is a leaf—but it simplifies some algorithms for operating on red-black
trees if the leaves really are explicit nodes. To save memory, sometimes a
single sentinel node performs the role of all leaf nodes; all references
from internal nodes to leaf nodes then point to the sentinel node.
(Source: Wikipedia.)
</p></div><p>
CFS uses the fair clock and wait runtime to keep all the runnable tasks
sorted by the rq-&gt;fair_clock - p-&gt;wait_runtime key in the rbtree (see
the Red-Black Tree sidebar). So, the leftmost task in the tree is the one
with the “gravest CPU
need”, and CFS picks the leftmost task and sticks to it. As the system
progresses forward, newly awakened tasks are put into the tree farther and
farther to the right—slowly but surely giving every task a chance to
become the leftmost task and, thus, get on the CPU within a deterministic
amount of time.
</p><p>
Because of this simple design, CFS no longer uses active and expired arrays
and dispensed with sophisticated heuristics to mark tasks as interactive
versus non-interactive.
</p><p>
CFS implements priorities by using
weighted tasks—each task is assigned a weight based
on its static priority. So, while running, the task with lower weight
(lower-priority) will see time elapse at a faster rate than that of a
higher-priority task. This means its wait_runtime will exhaust more quickly
than that of a higher-priority task, so lower-priority tasks will get less
CPU time compared to higher-priority tasks.
</p></div><div xml:lang="en" lang="en"><div><a></a>
Kernel 2.6.24</div><p>
CFS has been modified a bit further in 2.6.24. Although the basic
concept of fairness remains, a few implementation details have changed.
Now, instead of chasing the global fair clock (rq-&gt;fair_clock), tasks chase
each other. A clock per task, vruntime, is introduced, and an approximated
average is used to initialize this clock for new tasks. Each task tracks its
runtime and is queued in the RBTree using this parameter. So, the task that has
run least (the one that has the gravest CPU need) is the leftmost node of
the RBTree and will be picked up by the scheduler.
See Resources for more details about this implementation.
</p><p>
In kernel 2.6.24, another major addition to CFS is group
scheduling. Plain CFS tries to be fair to all the tasks
running in the system. For example, let's say there is a total of 25
runnable processes in the system. CFS tries to be fair by
allocating 4% of the CPU to all of them. However, let's say that out of these 25
processes, 20 belong to user A while 5 belong to user B. User B is at
an inherent disadvantage, as A is getting more CPU power than B. Group
scheduling tries to eliminate this problem. It first tries to be fair to a
group and then to individual tasks within that group. So CFS,
with group scheduling enabled, will allocate 50% of the CPU to each user A
and B. The allocated 50% share of A will be divided fairly among
A's 20 tasks, while the other 50% of the CPU time will be distributed
fairly among B's 5 tasks.
</p></div><div xml:lang="en" lang="en"><div><a></a>
Scheduling Classes/Modular Scheduler</div><p>
With kernel 2.6.23, the Linux scheduler also has
been made modular. Each
scheduling policy (SCHED_FIFO, SCHED_RR, SCHED_OTHER and so on) can be
implemented independently of the base scheduler code. This modularization
is similar to object-oriented class hierarchies (Figure 3).

Figure 3. Modular Scheduler
</p></div></div><p>
The core scheduler does not need to be aware of the implementation
details of the individual scheduling policies.
In kernel 2.6.23, sched.c (the “scheduler” from older kernels) is divided
into the following files to make the scheduler modular:
</p><div><ul type="disc"><li><p>
kernel/sched.c: contains the code of a generic scheduler, thereby
exposing functions like sched(). The specific scheduling policy is
implemented in a different file.
</p></li><li><p>
kernel/sched_fair.c: this is the main file that implements the CFS
scheduler and provides the SCHED_NORMAL, SCHED_BATCH and SCHED_IDLE
scheduling policies.
</p></li><li><p>
kernel/sched_rt.c: provides the SCHED_RR and SCHED_FIFO policies
used by real-time (RT) threads.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Each of these scheduling policies (fair and RT) registers its function
pointers with the core scheduler. The core scheduler calls the appropriate
scheduler (fair or RT),
based on the scheduling policy of the particular process. As with the O(1)
scheduler, real-time processes will have higher priority than normal processes.
CFS mainly addresses non-real-time processes, and the RT scheduler remains
more or less the same as before
(except for a few changes as to how non-active/expired arrays are maintained).
</p><p>
With this new modular scheduler in place, people who want to write new
schedulers for a particular policy can do so by simply registering these new
policy functions with the core scheduler.
</p></div>

Summary</div><p>
The CFS design is quite radical and innovative in its
approach. Features like the modular scheduler ease the task of integrating
new scheduler types to the core scheduler.
