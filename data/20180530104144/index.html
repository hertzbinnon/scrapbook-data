      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>As of early 2013, there are now an estimated 6.4 billion worldwide
      cellular connections. For 2012 alone, IDC market intelligence reports
      show an estimated 1.1 billion shipments for smart connected
      devices—smartphones, tablets, laptops, PCs, and so on. However, even more
      remarkable are the hockey stick growth projections for the years to come:
      the same IDC reports forecast the new device shipment numbers to climb to
      over 1.8 billion by 2016, and other cumulative forecasts estimate a total
      of over 20 billion connected devices by 2020.

      </p><p>With an estimated human population of 7 billion in 2012, rising to 7.5
      billion by 2020, these trends illustrate our insatiable appetite for
      smart connected devices: apparently, most of us are not satisfied with
      just one.

      </p><p>However, the absolute number of connected devices is only one small
      part of the overall story. Implicit in this growth is also the insatiable
      demand for high-speed connectivity, ubiquitous wireless broadband access,
      and the connected services that must power all of these new devices! This
      is where, and why, we must turn our conversation to the performance of
      the various cellular technologies, such as GSM, CDMA, HSPA, and LTE.
      Chances are, most of your users will be using one of these technologies,
      some exclusively, to access your site or service. The stakes are high, we
      have to get this right, and mobile networks definitely pose their own set
      of performance challenges.

      <p>Navigating the forest of the various cellular standards, release
      versions, and the pros and cons of each could occupy not chapters, but
      entire books. Our goal here is much more humble: we need to develop an
      intuition for the operating parameters, and their implications, of the
      major past and future milestones (<a data-type="xref" href="#wireless-history">Table&nbsp;7-1</a>) of the dominant wireless
      technologies in the market.

      <p>The first important realization is that the underlying standards for
      each wireless generation are expressed in terms of <em>peak spectral
      efficiency</em> (bps/Hz), which is then translated to impressive numbers
      such as Gbit/s+ peak data rates for 4G networks. However, you should now
      recognize the key word in the previous sentence: <em>peak!</em> Think
      back to our earlier discussion on <a data-type="xref" href="https://hpbn.co/introduction-to-wireless-networks/#measuring-real-world-wireless-performance">
      Measuring Real-World Wireless Performance</a>—peak data rates are
      achieved in ideal conditions.

      </p><p>Regardless of the standard, the real performance of every network will
      vary by provider, their configuration of the network, the number of
      active users in a given cell, the radio environment in a specific
      location, the device in use, plus all the other factors that affect
      wireless performance. With that in mind, while there are no guarantees
      for data rates in real-world environments, a simple but effective
      strategy to calibrate your performance expectations (<a data-type="xref" href="#cellular-performance">Table&nbsp;7-2</a>) is to assume much closer
      to the lower bound for data throughput, and toward the higher bound for
      packet latency for every generation.

      <p>To complicate matters further, the classification of any given network
      as 3G or 4G is definitely too coarse, and correspondingly so is the
      expected throughput and latency. To understand why this is the case, and
      where the industry is heading, we first need to take a quick survey of
      the history of the different technologies and the key players behind
      their evolution.

      </p><section>
        <h3 id="first-data-services-with-2g"><a href="#first-data-services-with-2g" class="anchor">§</a>First Data Services
        with 2G</h3>

        <p>The first commercial 1G network was launched in Japan in 1979. It
        was an analog system and offered no data capabilities. In 1991, the
        first 2G network was launched in Finland based on the emerging GSM
        (Global System for Mobile Communications, originally Groupe Spécial
        Mobile) standard, which introduced digital signaling within the radio
        network. This enabled first circuit-switched mobile data services, such
        as text messaging (SMS), and packet delivery at a whopping peak data
        rate of 9.6 Kbit/s!

        </p><p>It wasn’t until the mid 1990s, when general packet radio service
        (GPRS) was first introduced to the GSM standard that wireless Internet
        access became a practical, albeit still very slow, possibility: with
        GPRS, you could now reach 172 Kbit/s, with typical roundtrip latency
        hovering in high hundreds of milliseconds. The combination of GPRS and
        earlier 2G voice technologies is often described as 2.5G. A few years
        later, these networks were enhanced by EDGE (Enhanced Data rates for
        GSM Evolution), which increased the peak data rates to 384 Kbit/s. The
        first EDGE networks (2.75G) were launched in the U.S. in 2003.

        </p><p>At this point, a pause and some reflection is warranted. Wireless
        communication is many decades old, but practical, consumer-oriented
        data services over mobile networks are a recent phenomenon! 2.75G
        networks are barely a decade old, which is recent history, and are also
        still widely used around the world. Yet, most of us now simply can’t
        imagine living without high-speed wireless access. The rate of
        adoption, and the evolution of the wireless technologies, has been
        nothing short of breathtaking.
      </p></section>

        <h3 id="3gpp-and-3gpp2-partnerships"><a href="#3gpp-and-3gpp2-partnerships" class="anchor">§</a>3GPP and 3GPP2
        Partnerships</h3>

        <p>Once the consumer demand for wireless data services began to grow,
        the question of radio network interoperability became a hot issue for
        everyone involved. For one, the telecom providers must buy and deploy
        the hardware for the radio access network (RAN), which requires
        significant capital investments and ongoing maintenance—standard
        hardware means lower costs. Similarly, without industry-wide standards,
        the users would be restricted to their home networks, limiting the use
        cases and convenience of mobile data access.

        </p><p>In response, the European Telecommunication Standards Institute
        (ETSI) developed the GSM standard in the early 1990's, which was
        quickly adopted by many European countries and around the globe. In
        fact, GSM would go on to become the most widely deployed wireless
        standard, by some estimates, covering 80%–85% of the market
        (<a data-type="xref" href="#mobile-technologies">Figure&nbsp;7-1</a>).
        But it wasn’t the only one. In parallel, the IS-95 standard developed
        by Qualcomm also captured 10%–15% of the market, most notably with many
        network deployments across North America. As a result, a device
        designed for the IS-95 radio network cannot operate on the GSM network,
        and vice versa—an unfortunate property that is familiar to many
        international travelers.

        </p><figure id="mobile-technologies">

            standards for 2003–2007 (Wikipedia)
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>In 1998, recognizing the need for global evolution of the deployed
        standards, as well as defining the requirements for the next generation
        (3G) networks, the participants in GSM and IS-95 standards
        organizations formed two global partnership projects:

        </p><dl>
          <dt>3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)

          </dt><dd>
            <p>Responsible for developing the Universal Mobile
            Telecommunication System (UMTS), which is the 3G upgrade to GSM
            networks. Later, it also assumed maintenance of the GSM standard
            and development of the new LTE standards.

          </p></dd><dt>3rd Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2)

          </dt><dd>
            <p>Responsible for developing the 3G specifications based on the
            CDMA2000 technology, which is a successor to the IS-95 standard
            developed by Qualcomm.
        </p></dd></dl>

        <p>Consequently, the development of both types of standards
        (<a data-type="xref" href="#cellular-standards">Table&nbsp;7-3</a>) and
        associated network infrastructure has proceeded in parallel. Perhaps
        not directly in lockstep, but nonetheless following mostly similar
        evolution of the underlying technologies.

        <p>Chances are, you should see some familiar labels on the list: EV-DO,
        HSPA, LTE. Many network operators have invested significant marketing
        resources, and continue to do so, to promote these technologies as
        their "latest and fastest mobile data networks." However, our interest
        and the reason for this historical detour is not for the marketing, but
        for the macro observations of the evolution of the mobile wireless
        industry:

        </p><ul>
          <li>
            <p>There are two dominant, deployed mobile network types around the
            world.

          </p></li><li>
            <p>3GPP and 3GPP2 manage the evolution of each technology.

          </p></li><li>
            <p>3GPP and 3GPP2 standards are not device interoperable.
        </p></li></ul>

        <p>There is no one 4G or 3G technology. The International
        Telecommunication Union (ITU) sets the international standards and
        performance characteristics, such as data rates and latency, for each
        wireless generation, and the 3GPP and 3GPP2 organizations then define
        the standards to meet and exceed these expectations within the context
        of their respective technologies.

        Technologies</h3>

        <p>In the context of 3G networks, we have two dominant and competing
        standards: UMTS and CDMA-based networks, which are developed by 3GPP
        and 3GPP2, respectively. However as the earlier table of cellular
        standards (<a data-type="xref" href="#cellular-standards">Table&nbsp;7-3</a>) shows, each is also split
        into several transitional milestones: 3.5G, 3.75G, and 3.9G
        technologies.

        </p><p>Why couldn’t we simply jump to 4G instead? Well, standards take a
        long time to develop, but even more importantly, there are big
        financial costs for deploying new network infrastructure. As we will
        see, 4G requires an entirely different radio interface and parallel
        infrastructure to 3G. Because of this, and also for the benefit of the
        many users who have purchased 3G handsets, both 3GPP and 3GPP2 have
        continued to evolve the existing 3G standards, which also enables the
        operators to incrementally upgrade their existing networks to deliver
        better performance to their existing users.

        </p><p>Not surprisingly, the throughput, latency, and other performance
        characteristics of the various 3G networks have improved, sometimes
        dramatically, with every new release. In fact, technically, LTE is
        considered a 3.9G transitional standard! However, before we get to LTE,
        let’s take a closer look at the various 3GPP and 3GPP2 milestones.

          <p>In the case of networks following the 3GPP standards, the
          combination of HSDPA and HSUPA releases is often known and marketed
          as a High-Speed Packet Access (HSPA) network. This combination of the
          two releases enabled low single-digit Mbit/s throughput in real-world
          deployments, which was a significant step up from the early 3G
          speeds. HSPA networks are often labeled as 3.5G.

          </p><p>From there, the next upgrade was HSPA+ (3.75G), which offered
          significantly lower latencies thanks to a simplified core network
          architecture and data rates in mid to high single-digit Mbit/s
          throughput in real-world deployments. However, as we will see,
          release 7, which introduced HSPA+, was not the end of the line for
          this technology. In fact, the HSPA+ standards have been continuously
          refined since then and are now competing head to head with LTE and
          LTE-Advanced!

            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>The CDMA2000 EV-DO standard developed by 3GPP2 followed a similar
          network upgrade path. The first release (Rel. 0) enabled low single
          digit Mbit/s downlink throughput but very low uplink speeds. The
          uplink performance was addressed with Rev. A, and both uplink and
          downlink speeds were further improved in Rev. B. Hence, a Rev. B
          network was able to deliver mid to high single-digit Mbit/s
          performance to its users, which makes it comparable to HSPA and early
          HSPA+ networks—aka, 3.5–3.75G.

          </p><p>The Rev. C release is also frequently referred to as EV-DO
          Advanced and offers significant operational improvements in capacity
          and performance. However, the adoption of EV-DO Advanced has not been
          nearly as strong as that of HSPA+. Why? If you paid close attention
          to the standards generation table (<a data-type="xref" href="#cellular-standards">Table&nbsp;7-3</a>), you may have noticed that
          3GPP2 does not have an official and competing 4G standard!

          </p><p>While 3GPP2 could have continued to evolve its CDMA technologies,
          at some point both the network operators and the network vendors
          agreed on 3GPP LTE as a <em>common 4G successor</em> to all types of
          networks. For this reason, many of the CDMA network operators are
          also some of the first to invest into early LTE infrastructure, in
          part to be able to compete with ongoing HSPA+ improvements.

          </p><p>In other words, most mobile operators around the world are
          converging on HSPA+ and LTE as the future mobile wireless
          standards—that’s the good news. Having said that, don’t hold your
          breath. Existing 2G and 3–3.75G technologies are still powering the
          vast majority of deployed mobile radio networks, and even more
          importantly, will remain operational for at least another decade.

          </p><div data-type="note" id="id-ABtDhGSOtQca">
            <p>3G is often described as "mobile broadband." However, broadband
            is a relative term. Some pin it as a communication bandwidth of at
            least 256 Kbit/s, others as that exceeding 640 Kbit/s, but the
            truth is that the value keeps changing based on the experience we
            are trying to achieve. As the services evolve and demand higher
            throughput, so does the definition of broadband.

            </p><p>In that light, it might be more useful to think of 3G standards
            as those targeting and exceeding the Mbit/s bandwidth threshold.
            How far over the Mbit/s barrier? Well, that depends on the release
            version of the standard (as we saw earlier), the carrier
            configuration of the network, and the capabilities of the device in
            use.

        <h3 id="imt-advanced-4g-requirements"><a href="#imt-advanced-4g-requirements" class="anchor">§</a>IMT-Advanced 4G
        Requirements</h3>

        <p>Before we dissect the various 4G technologies, it is important to
        understand what stands behind the "4G" label. Just as with 3G, there is
        no one 4G technology. Rather, 4G is a set of requirements
        (IMT-Advanced) that was developed and published by the ITU back in
        2008. Any technology that meets these requirements can be labeled as
        4G.

        </p><p>Some example requirements of IMT-Advanced include the following:

        </p><ul>
          <li>
            <p>Based on an IP packet switched network

          </p></li><li>
            <p>Interoperable with previous wireless standards (3G and 2G)

          </p></li><li>
            <p>100 Mbit/s data rate for mobile clients and Gbit/s+ when
            stationary

          </p></li><li>
            <p>Sub 100 ms control-plane latency and sub 10 ms user-plane
            latency

          </p></li><li>
            <p>Dynamic allocation and sharing of network resources between
            users

          </p></li><li>
            <p>Use of variable bandwidth allocation, from 5 to 20 MHz
        </p></li></ul>

        <p>The actual list is much, much longer but the preceding captures the
        highlights important for our discussion: much higher throughput and
        significantly lower latencies when compared to earlier generations.
        Armed with these criteria, we now know how to classify a 4G
        network—right? Not so fast, that would be too easy! The marketing
        departments also had to have their say.

        </p><p>LTE-Advanced is a standard that was specifically developed to
        satisfy all the IMT-Advanced criteria. In fact, it was also the first
        3GPP standard to do so. However, if you were paying close attention,
        you would have noticed that LTE (release 8) and LTE-Advanced (release
        10) are, in fact, different standards. Technically, LTE should really
        be considered a 3.9G transitional standard, even though it lays much of
        the necessary groundwork to meet the 4G requirements—it is almost
        there, but not quite!

        </p><p>However, this is where the marketing steps in. The 3G and 4G
        trademarks are held by the ITU, and hence their use should correspond
        to defined requirements for each generation. Except the carriers won a
        marketing coup and were able to redefine the "4G" trademark to include
        a set of technologies that are <em>significantly close</em> to the 4G
        requirements. For this reason, LTE (release 8) and most HSPA+ networks,
        which do not meet the actual technical 4G requirements, are nonetheless
        marketed as "4G."

        </p><p>What about the real (LTE-Advanced) 4G deployments? Those are coming,
        but it remains to be seen how these networks will be marketed in light
        of their earlier predecessors. Regardless, the point is, the "4G" label
        as it is used today by many carriers is ambiguous, and you should read
        the fine print to understand the technology behind it.

      <section>
        <h3 id="long-term-evolution-lte"><a href="#long-term-evolution-lte" class="anchor">§</a>Long Term Evolution (LTE)</h3>

        <p>Despite the continuous evolution of the 3G standards, the increased
        demand for high data transmission speeds and lower latencies exposed a
        number of inherent design limitations in the earlier UMTS technologies.
        To address this, 3GPP set out to redesign both the core and the radio
        networks, which led to the creation of the aptly named Long Term
        Evolution (LTE) standard:

        </p><ul>
          <li>
            <p>All IP core network

          </p></li><li>
            <p>Simplified network architecture to lower costs

          </p></li><li>
            <p>Low latencies in user (&lt;10 ms) and control planes (&lt;100
            ms)

          </p></li><li>
            <p>New radio interface and modulation for high throughput (100
            Mbps)

          </p></li><li>
            <p>Ability to use larger bandwidth allocations and carrier
            aggregation

          </p></li><li>
            <p>MIMO as a requirement for all devices
        </p></li></ul>

        <p>Not surprisingly, the preceding list should read similar to the
        IMT-Advanced requirements we saw earlier. LTE (release 8) laid the
        groundwork for the new network architecture, and LTE-Advanced (release
        10) delivered the necessary improvements to meet the true 4G
        requirements set by IMT-Advanced.

        </p><p>At this point it is important to note that due to radio and core
        network implementation differences, LTE networks are not simple
        upgrades to existing 3G infrastructure. Instead, LTE networks must be
        deployed in parallel and on separate spectrum from existing 3G
        infrastructure. However, since LTE is a common successor to both UMTS
        and CDMA standards, it does provide a way to interoperate with both: an
        LTE subscriber can be seamlessly handed off to a 3G network and be
        migrated back where LTE infrastructure is available.

        </p><p>Finally, as the name implies, LTE is definitely the long-term
        evolution plan for virtually all future mobile networks. The only
        question is, how distant is this future? A few carriers have already
        begun investing into LTE infrastructure, and many others are beginning
        to look for the spectrum, funds, or both, to do so. However, current
        industry estimates show that this migration will indeed be a
        <em>long-term one</em>—perhaps over the course of the next decade or
        so. In the meantime, HSPA+ is set to take the center stage.

        </p><div data-type="note" id="id-rLtKhqfqc5">
          <p>Every LTE-capable device must have multiple radios for mandatory
          MIMO support. However, each device will also need separate radio
          interfaces for earlier 3G and 2G networks. If you are counting, that
          translates to three or four radios in every handset! For higher data
          rates with LTE, you will need 4x MIMO, which brings the total to five
          or six radios. You were wondering why your battery is drained so
          quickly?

        Leading Worldwide 4G Adoption</h3>

        <p>HSPA+ was first introduced in 3GPP release 7, back in 2007. However,
        while the popular attention quickly shifted toward LTE, which was first
        introduced in 3GPP release 8 in 2008, what is often overlooked is that
        the development of HSPA+ did not cease and continued to coevolve in
        parallel. In fact, HSPA+ release 10 meets many of the IMT-Advanced
        criteria. But, you may ask, if we have LTE and everyone is in agreement
        that it is <em>the standard</em> for future mobile networks, why
        continue to develop and invest into HSPA+? As usual, the answer is a
        simple one: cost.

        </p><p>3GPP 3G technologies command the lion’s share of the established
        wireless market around the world, which translates into huge existing
        infrastructure investments by the carriers around the globe. Migrating
        to LTE requires development of new radio networks, which once again
        translates into significant capital expenditures. By contrast, HSPA+
        offers a much more capital efficient route: the carriers can deploy
        incremental upgrades to their existing networks and get comparable
        performance.

        </p><p>Cost-effectiveness is the name of the game and the reason why
        current industry projections (<a data-type="xref" href="#growth-4g">Figure&nbsp;7-2</a>) show HSPA+ as responsible for the
        majority of 4G upgrades around the world for years to come. In the
        meantime, CDMA technologies developed by 3GPP2 will continue to
        coexist, although their number of subscriptions is projected to start
        declining slowly, while new LTE deployments will proceed in parallel
        with different rates in different regions—in part due to cost
        constraints, and in part due to different regulation and the
        availability of required radio spectrum.

        </figure>

        <p>For a variety of reasons, North America appears to be the leader in
        LTE adoption: current industry projections show the number of LTE
        subscribers in U.S. and Canada surpassing that of HSPA by 2016
        (<a data-type="xref" href="#growth-4g-na">Figure&nbsp;7-3</a>).
        However, the rate of LTE adoption in North America appears to be
        significantly more aggressive than in most other countries. Within the
        global context, HSPA+ is set to be the dominant mobile wireless
        technology of the current decade.

          <p>While many are first surprised by the trends in the HSPA+ vs. LTE
          adoption, this is not an unexpected outcome. If nothing else, it
          serves to illustrate an important point: it takes roughly a decade
          from the first specification of a new wireless standard to its
          mainstream availability in real-world wireless networks.

          </p><p>By extension, it is a fairly safe bet that we will be talking
          about LTE-Advanced in earnest by the early 2020s! Unfortunately,
          deploying new radio infrastructure is a costly and time-consuming
          proposition.

        for the Multigeneration Future</h3>

        <p>Crystal ball gazing is a dangerous practice in our industry.
        However, by this point we have covered enough to make some reasonable
        predictions about what we can and should expect out of the currently
        deployed mobile networks, as well as where we might be in a few years’
        time.

        </p><p>First, the wireless standards are evolving quickly, but the physical
        rollout of these networks is both a costly and a time-consuming
        exercise. Further, once deployed, the network must be maintained for
        significant amounts of time to recoup the costs and to keep existing
        customers online. In other words, while there is a lot of hype and
        marketing around 4G, older-generation networks will continue to operate
        for at least another decade. When building for the mobile web, plan
        accordingly.

        </p><div data-type="note" id="id-pQtyTMiwc8">
          <p>Ironically, while 4G networks provide significant improvements for
          IP data delivery, 3G networks are still much more efficient in
          handling the old-fashioned voice traffic! Voice over LTE (VoLTE) is
          currently in active development and aims to enable efficient and
          reliable voice over 4G, but most current 4G deployments still rely on
          the older, circuit-switched infrastructure for voice delivery.
        </p></div>

        <p>Consequently, when building applications for mobile networks, we
        cannot target a single type or generation of network, or worse, hope
        for specific throughput or latency performance. As we saw, the actual
        performance of any network is highly variable, based on deployed
        release, infrastructure, radio conditions, and a dozen other variables.
        Our applications should adapt to the continuously changing conditions
        within the network: throughput, latency, and even the availability of
        the radio connection. When the user is on the go, it is highly likely
        that he may transition between multiple generations of networks (LTE,
        HSPA+, HSPA, EV-DO, and even GPRS Edge) based on the available coverage
        and signal strength. If the application fails to account for this, then
        the user experience will suffer.

        </p><p>The good news is HSPA+ and LTE adoption is growing very fast, which
        enables an entirely new class of high-throughput and latency-sensitive
        applications previously not possible. Both are effectively on par in
        throughput and latency (<a data-type="xref" href="#hspa-to-lte-advanced">Table&nbsp;7-6</a>): mid to high digit Mbps
        throughput in real-world environments, and sub-100-millisecond latency,
        which makes them comparable to many home and office WiFi networks.

        <p>However, while 4G wireless performance is often compared to that of
        WiFi, or wired broadband, it would be incorrect to assume that we can
        get away with treating them as the same environments: that they are
        definitely not.

        </p><p>For example, most users and developers expect an "always on"
        experience where the device is permanently connected to the Internet
        and is ready to instantaneously react to user input or an incoming data
        packet. This assumption holds true in the tethered world but is
        definitely incorrect for mobile networks. Practical constraints such as
        battery life and device capabilities mean that we must design our
        applications with explicit awareness of the constraints of mobile
        networks. To understand these differences, let’s dig a little deeper.

          Latency</h4>

          <p>User-plane one-way latency is the target time specified by the LTE
          standard for the one-way transit between a packet being available in
          the wireless device and the same packet being available at the radio
          tower. In other words, it is the one-way latency of the first
          wireless hop when the device is in the high-power continuous
          reception state. Every application packet will incur this cost—no
          shortcuts.

      and Capabilities</h2>

      <p>What is often forgotten is that the deployed radio network is only
      half of the equation. It goes without saying that devices from different
      manufacturers and release dates will have very different characteristics:
      CPU speeds and core counts, amount of available memory, storage capacity,
      GPU, and more. Each of these factors will affect the overall performance
      of the device and the applications running on it.

      </p><p>However, even with all of these variables accounted for, when it comes
      to network performance, there is one more section that is often
      overlooked: radio capabilities. Specifically, the device that the user is
      holding in her hands must also be able to take advantage of the deployed
      radio infrastructure! The carrier may deploy the latest LTE
      infrastructure, but a device designed for an earlier release may simply
      not be able to take advantage of it, and vice versa.

      </p><section>
        <h3 id="user-equipment-category"><a href="#user-equipment-category" class="anchor">§</a>User Equipment Category</h3>

        <p>Both the 3GPP and 3GPP2 standards continue to evolve and enhance the
        radio interface requirements: modulation schemes, number of radios, and
        so on. To get the best performance out of any network, the device must
        also meet the specified user equipment (UE) category requirements for
        each type of network. In fact, for each release, there are often
        multiple UE categories, each of which will offer very different radio
        performance.

        </p><p>An obvious and important question is, why? Once again, the answer is
        a simple one: cost. Availability of multiple categories of devices
        enables device differentiation, various price points for
        price-sensitive users, and ability to adapt to deployed network
        infrastructure on the ground.

        </p><p>The HSPA standard alone specifies over 36 possible UE categories!
        Hence, just saying that you have an "HSPA capable device"
        (<a data-type="xref" href="#hspa-ue">Table&nbsp;7-7</a>) is not
        enough—you need to read the fine print. For example, assuming the radio
        network is capable, to get the 42.2 Mbps/s throughput, you would also
        need a category 20 (2x MIMO), or category 24 (dual-cell) device.
        Finally, to confuse matters further, a category 21 device does not
        automatically guarantee higher throughput over a category 20 handset.

        <p>Similarly, the LTE standard defines its own set of user equipment
        categories (<a data-type="xref" href="#lte-ue">Table&nbsp;7-8</a>): a
        high-end smartphone is likely to be a category 3–5 device, but it will
        also likely share the network with a lot of cheaper category 1–2
        neighbors. Higher UE categories, which require 4x and even 8x MIMO, are
        more likely to be found in specialized devices—powering that many
        radios simultaneously consumes a lot of power, which may not be very
        practical for something in your pocket!

        <p>If you own an LTE or an HSPA+ device, do you know its category

          <a href="#deciphering-the-radio-specification-on-a-mobile-device" class="anchor">§</a>Deciphering the Radio Specification on a Mobile
          Device</h4>

          <p>If you have ever read the technical specification of your mobile
          device, you would have no doubt noticed a long and confusing list of
          frequencies and technology types under the connectivity section.
          Well, now we should know enough to decipher this list! As an example,
          let’s take a look at the specification for Google’s Nexus 4:

          </p><ul>
            <li>
              <p>GSM/EDGE/GPRS (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz)

            </p></li><li>
              <p>3G (850, 900, 1700, 1900, 2100 MHz)

            </p></li><li>
              <p>HSPA+ 42
          </p></li></ul>

          <p>The first line tells us that the device can operate on 2G networks
          and is GPRS (2.5G) and EDGE (2.75G) capable—hundreds of Kbit/s peak
          data rates. The list of frequencies indicates the bands on which the
          radio is able to operate, to account for the different regulations
          and network deployments around the world.

          </p><p>The second line is similar, except that it doesn’t indicate much
          in terms of maximum 3G throughput. But that is exactly what the third
          line reveals: HSPA+ indicates that the phone can operate on 3.75G
          networks, and the "42" tells us that it is either a category 20
          device with MIMO, or a category 24 dual-cell device with maximum data
          rate of 42.2 Mbps in the downlink—that is, if the network allows it.
          In fact, Nexus 4 is a category 24 dual-cell device.

          </p><p>Finally, this phone is not LTE capable; for that it would need
          another radio interface, in addition to the 2G and 3G radios. Many
          mobile phones are already miracles of miniaturization, but this fact
          is only more impressive when you realize that most modern phones
          don’t just have one radio: most have somewhere between two and four!

      <h2 id="radio-resource-controller-rrc"><a href="#radio-resource-controller-rrc" class="anchor">§</a>Radio Resource
      Controller (RRC)</h2>

      <p>Both 3G and 4G networks have a unique feature that is not present in
      tethered and even WiFi networks. The Radio Resource Controller (RRC)
      mediates all connection management between the device in use and the
      radio base station (<a data-type="xref" href="#rrc-diagram">Figure&nbsp;7-4</a>). Understanding why it exists, and how
      it affects the performance of every device on a mobile network, is
      critical to building high-performance mobile applications. The RRC has
      direct impact on latency, throughput, and battery life of the device in
      use.

        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>When using a physical connection, such as an Ethernet cable, your
      computer has a direct and an always-on network link, which allows either
      side of this connection to send data packets at any time; this is the
      best possible case for minimizing latency. As we saw in <a data-type="xref" href="https://hpbn.co/wifi/#from-ethernet-to-a-wireless-lan">From Ethernet to a
      Wireless LAN</a>, the WiFi standard follows a similar model, where each
      device is able to transmit at any point in time. This too provides
      minimum latency in the best case, but due to the use of the shared radio
      medium can also lead to high collision rates and unpredictable
      performance if there are many active users. Further, because any WiFi
      peer could start transmitting at any time, all others must also be ready
      to receive. The radio is always on, which consumes a lot of power.

      </p><p>In practice, keeping the WiFi radio active at all times is simply too
      expensive, as battery capacity is a limited resource on most devices.
      Hence, WiFi offers a small power optimization where the access point
      broadcasts a delivery traffic indication message (DTIM) within a periodic
      beacon frame to indicate that it will be transmitting data for certain
      clients immediately after. In turn, the clients can listen for these DTIM
      frames as hints for when the radio should be ready to receive, and
      otherwise the radio can sleep until the next DTIM transmission. This
      lowers battery use but adds extra latency.

      </p><div data-type="note" id="id-MLt9SAhr">
        <p>The upcoming WiFi Multimedia (WMM) standard will further improve the
        power efficiency of WiFi devices with the help of the new PowerSave
        mechanisms such as NoAck and APSD (Automatic Power Save Delivery).
      </p></div>

      <p>Therein lies the problem for 3G and 4G networks: network efficiency
      and power. Or rather, lack of power, due to the fact that mobile devices
      are constrained by their battery capacity and a requirement for high
      network efficiency among a significantly larger number of active users in
      the cell. This is why the RRC exists.

      </p><p>As the name implies, the Radio Resource Controller assumes full
      responsibility over scheduling of who talks when, allocated bandwidth,
      the signal power used, the power state of each device, and a dozen other
      variables. Simply put, the RRC is the brains of the radio access network.
      Want to send data over the wireless channel? You must first ask the RRC
      to allocate some radio resources for you. Have incoming data from the
      Internet? The RRC will notify you for when to listen to receive the
      inbound packets.

      </p><p>The good news is all the RRC management is performed by the network.
      The bad news is, while you can’t necessarily control the RRC via an API,
      if you do want to optimize your application for 3G and 4G networks, then
      you need to be aware of and work within the constraints imposed by the
      RRC.

      </p><div data-type="note" id="id-R5tnt1h4">
        <p>The RRC lives within the radio network. In 2G and 3G networks, the
        RRC lived in the core carrier network, and in 4G the RRC logic has been
        moved directly to the serving radio tower (eNodeB) to improve
        performance and reduce coordination latency.

        <h3 id="3g-4g-and-wifi-power-requirements"><a href="#3g-4g-and-wifi-power-requirements" class="anchor">§</a>3G, 4G, and
        WiFi Power Requirements</h3>

        <p>The radio is one of the most power-hungry components of any handset.
        In fact, the screen is the only component that consumes higher amounts
        of power when active—emphasis on active. In practice, the screen is off
        for significant periods of time, whereas the radio must maintain the
        illusion of an "always-on" experience such that the user is reachable
        at any point in time.

        </p><p>One way to achieve this goal is to keep the radio active at all
        times, but even with the latest advances in battery capacity, doing so
        would drain the battery in a matter of hours. Worse, latest iterations
        of the 3G and 4G standards require parallel transmissions (MIMO,
        Multicell, etc.), which is equivalent to powering multiple radios at
        once. In practice, a balance must be struck between keeping the radio
        active to service low-latency interactive traffic and cycling into
        low-power states to enable reasonable battery performance.

        </p><p>How do the different technologies compare, and which is better for
        battery life? There is no one single answer. With WiFi, each device
        sets its own transmit power, which is usually in the 30–200 mW range.
        By comparison, the transmit power of the 3G/4G radio is managed by the
        network and can consume as low as 15 mW when in an idle state. However,
        to account for larger range and interference, the same radio can
        require 1,000–3,500 mW when transmitting in a high-power state!

        </p><p>In practice, when transferring large amounts of data, WiFi is often
        far more efficient if the signal strength is good. But if the device is
        mostly idle, then the 3G/4G radio is more effective. For best
        performance, ideally we would want dynamic switching between the
        different connection types. However, at least for the moment, no such
        mechanism exists. This is an active area of research, both in the
        industry and academia.

        </p><p>So how does the battery and power management affect networking
        performance? Signal power (explained <a data-type="xref" href="https://hpbn.co/introduction-to-wireless-networks/#signal-power" class="select: pagenumber">Signal Power</a>) is one of the primary levers to
        achieve higher throughput. However, high transmit power consumes
        significant amounts of energy and hence may be throttled to achieve
        better battery life. Similarly, powering down the radio may also tear
        down the radio link to the radio tower altogether, which means that in
        the event of a new transmission, a series of control messages must be
        first exchanged to reestablish the radio context, which can add tens
        and even hundreds of milliseconds of latency.

        </p><p>Both throughput and latency performance are directly impacted by the
        power management profile of the device in use. In fact, and this is
        key, in 3G and 4G networks the radio power management is controlled by
        the RRC: not only does it tell you when to communicate, but it will
        also tell you the transmit power and when to cycle into different power
        states.

        <p>The radio state of every LTE device is controlled by the radio tower
        currently servicing the user. In fact, the 3GPP standard defines a
        well-specified state machine, which describes the possible power states
        of each device connected to the network (<a data-type="xref" href="#lte-rrc-diagram">Figure&nbsp;7-5</a>). The network operator can make
        modifications to the parameters that trigger the state transitions, but
        the state machine itself is the same across all LTE deployments.

        <dl>
          <dt>RRC Idle

          </dt><dd>
            <p>Device radio is in a low-power state (&lt;15 mW) and only
            listening to control traffic. No radio resources are assigned to
            the client within the carrier network.

          </p></dd><dt>RRC Connected

          </dt><dd>
            <p>Device radio is in a high-power state (1000–3500 mW) while it
            either transmits data or waits for data, and dedicated radio
            resources are allocated by the radio network.
        </p></dd></dl>

        <p>The device is either idle, in which case it is only listening to
        control channel broadcasts, such as paging notifications of inbound
        traffic, or connected, in which case the network has an established
        context and resource assignment for the client.

        </p><p>When in an idle state, the device cannot send or receive any data.
        To do so, it must first synchronize itself to the network by listening
        to the network broadcasts and then issue a request to the RRC to be
        moved to the "connected" state. This negotiation can take several
        roundtrips to establish, and the 3GPP LTE specification allocates a
        target of 100 milliseconds or less for this state transition. In
        LTE-Advanced, the target time was further reduced to 50 milliseconds.

        </p><p>Once in a connected state, a network context is established between
        the radio tower and the LTE device, and data can be transferred.
        However, once either side completes the intended data transfer, how
        does the RRC know when to transition the device to a lower power state?
        Trick question—it doesn’t!

        </p><p>IP traffic is bursty, optimized TCP connections are long-lived, and
        UDP traffic provides no "end of transmission" indicator by design. As a
        result, and not unlike the NAT connection-state timeouts solution
        covered <a data-type="xref" href="https://hpbn.co/building-blocks-of-udp/#connection-state-timeouts" class="select: pagenumber">Connection-State Timeouts</a>, the RRC state
        machine depends on a collection of timers to trigger the RRC state
        transitions.

        </p><p>Finally, because the connected state requires such high amounts of
        power, multiple sub-states are available (<a data-type="xref" href="#lte-rrc-diagram">Figure&nbsp;7-5</a>) to allow for more efficient
        operation:

        </p><dl>
          <dt>Continuous reception

          </dt><dd>
            <p>Highest power state, established network context, allocated
            network resources.

          </p></dd><dt>Short Discontinuous Reception (Short DRX)

          </dt><dd>
            <p>Established network context, no allocated network resources.

          </dt><dd>
            <p>Established network context, no allocated network resources.
        </p></dd></dl>

        <p>In the high-power state, the RRC creates a reservation for the
        device to receive and transmit data over the wireless interface and
        notifies the device for what these time-slots are, the transmit power
        that must be used, the modulation scheme, and a dozen other variables.
        Then, if the device has been idle for a configured period of time, it
        is transitioned to a Short DRX power state, where the network context
        is still maintained, but no specific radio resources are assigned. When
        in Short DRX state, the device only listens to periodic broadcasts from
        the network, which allows it to preserve the battery—not unlike the
        DTIM interval in WiFi.

        </p><aside>
          <h4 id="what-are-assigned-radio-resources"><a href="#what-are-assigned-radio-resources" class="anchor">§</a>What Are
          "Assigned Radio Resources"?</h4>

          <p>In LTE, just as in most other modern wireless standards, there are
          shared uplink and downlink radio channels, the access to which is
          controlled by the RRC. When in a connected state, the RRC tells each
          and every device which timeslots are assigned to whom, which transmit
          power must be used, modulation, plus a dozen other variables.

          </p><p>If the mobile device does not have an assignment for these
          resources by the RRC, then it cannot transmit or receive any user
          data. Consequently, when in a DRX state, the device is synchronized
          to the RRC, but no uplink or downlink resources are allocated to it:
          the device is "half awake."
        </p></aside>

        <p>If the radio remains idle long enough, it is then transitioned to
        the Long DRX state, which is identical to the Short DRX state, except
        that the device sleeps for longer periods of time between waking up to
        listen to the broadcasts (<a data-type="xref" href="#drx">Figure&nbsp;7-6</a>).

        </p><figure id="drx">

            Short DRX and Long DRX
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>What happens if the network or the mobile device must transmit data
        when the radio is in one of Short or Long DRX (dormant) states? The
        device and the RRC must first exchange control messages to negotiate
        when to transmit and when to listen to radio broadcasts. For LTE, this
        negotiation time ("dormant to connected") is specified as less than 50
        milliseconds, and further tightened to less than 10 milliseconds for
        LTE-Advanced.

        </p><p>So what does this all mean in practice? Depending on which power
        state the radio is in, an LTE device may first require anywhere from 10
        to 100 milliseconds (<a data-type="xref" href="#lte-rrc-latency">Table&nbsp;7-9</a>) of latency to negotiate the
        required resources with the RRC. Following that, application data can
        be transferred over the wireless link, through the carrier’s network,
        and then out to the public Internet. Planning for these delays,
        especially when designing latency-sensitive applications, can be all
        the difference between "unpredictable performance" and an optimized
        mobile application.

        HSPA+ (UMTS) RRC State Machine</h3>

        <p>Earlier generation 3GPP networks prior to LTE and LTE-Advanced have
        a very similar RRC state machine that is also maintained by the radio
        network. That’s the good news. The bad news is the state machine for
        earlier generations is a bit more complicated (<a data-type="xref" href="#umts-rrc">Figure&nbsp;7-7</a>), and the latencies are much, much
        higher. In fact, one reason why LTE offers better performance is
        precisely due to the simplified architecture and improved performance
        of the RRC state transitions.

        </p><figure id="umts-rrc">

            and only listening to control traffic from the network. No radio
            resources are assigned to the client within the carrier network.

          </p></dd><dt>Cell DCH

          </dt><dd>
            <p>Similar to connected LTE mode when in continuous reception. The
            device is in a high-power state, and network resources are assigned
            both for upstream and downstream data transfer.

          </p></dd><dt>Cell FACH

          </dt><dd>
            <p>An intermediate power state, which consumes significantly less
            power than DCH. The device does not have dedicated network
            resources but is nonetheless able to transmit small amounts of user
            data through a shared low-speed channel (with speeds of typically
            less than 20 Kbps).
        </p></dd></dl>

        <p>Idle and DCH states are nearly identical to that of idle and
        connected in LTE. However, the intermediate FACH state is unique to
        UMTS networks (HSPA, HSPA+) and allows the use of a common channel for
        small data transfers: slow, steady, and consuming roughly half the
        power of the DCH state. In practice, this state was designed to handle
        non-interactive traffic, such as periodic polling and status checks
        done by many background applications.

        </p><p>Not surprisingly, the transition from DCH to FACH is triggered by a
        timer. However, once in FACH, what triggers a promotion back to DCH?
        Each device maintains a buffer of data to be sent, and as long as the
        buffer does not exceed a network-configured threshold, typically
        anywhere from 100 to 1,000 bytes, then the device can remain in the
        intermediate state. Finally, if no data is transferred while in FACH
        for some period of time, another timer transitions the device down to
        the idle state.

        </p><div data-type="note" id="id-ABtDhXHoh3">
          <p>Unlike LTE, which offers two intermediate states (Short DRX and
          Long DRX), UMTS devices have just a single intermediate state: FACH.
          However, even though LTE offers a theoretically higher degree of
          power control, the radios themselves tend to consume more power in
          LTE devices; higher throughput comes at a cost of increased battery
          consumption. Hence, LTE devices still have a much higher power
          profile than their 3G predecessors.
        </p></div>

        <p>Individual power states aside, perhaps the biggest difference
        between the earlier-generation 3G networks and LTE is the latency of
        the state transitions. Where LTE targets sub-hundred milliseconds for
        idle to connected states, the same transition from idle to DCH can take
        up to two seconds and require tens of control messages between the 3G
        device and the RRC! FACH to DCH is not much better either, requiring up
        to one and a half seconds for the state transition.

        </p><p>The good news is the latest HSPA+ networks have made significant
        improvements in this department and are now competitive with LTE
        (<a data-type="xref" href="#hspa-to-lte-advanced">Table&nbsp;7-6</a>).
        However, we can’t count on ubiquitous access to 4G or HSPA+ networks;
        older generation 3G networks will continue to exist for at least
        another decade. Hence, all mobile applications should plan for
        multisecond RRC latency delays when accessing the network over a 3G
        interface.

        <p>While 3GPP standards such as HSPA, HSPA+, and LTE are the dominant
        network standards around the globe, it is important that we don’t
        forget the 3GPP2 CDMA based networks. The growth curve for EV-DO
        networks may look comparatively flat, but even so, current industry
        projections show nearly half a billion CDMA powered wireless
        subscriptions by 2017.

        </p><p>Not surprisingly, regardless of the differences in the standards,
        the fundamental limitations are the same in UMTS- and CDMA-based
        networks: battery power is a constraining resource, radios are
        expensive to operate, and network efficiency is an important goal.
        Consequently, CDMA networks also have an RRC state machine
        (<a data-type="xref" href="#cdma-rrc">Figure&nbsp;7-8</a>), which
        controls the radio state of each device.

        <p>This is definitely the simplest RRC state machine out of all the
        ones we have examined: the device is either in a high-power state, with
        allocated network resources, or it is idle. Further, all network
        transfers require a transition to a connected state, the latency for
        which is similar to that of HSPA networks: hundreds to thousands of
        milliseconds depending on the revision of the deployed infrastructure.
        There are no other intermediate states, and transitions back to idle
        are also controlled via carrier configured timeouts.

        <h3 id="inefficiency-of-periodic-transfers"><a href="#inefficiency-of-periodic-transfers" class="anchor">§</a>Inefficiency
        of Periodic Transfers</h3>

        <p>An important consequence of the timeout-driven radio state
        transitions, regardless of the generation or the underlying standard,
        is that it is very easy to construct network access patterns that can
        yield both poor user experience for interactive traffic and poor
        battery performance. In fact, all you have to do is wait long enough
        for the radio to transition to a lower-power state, and then trigger a
        network access to force an RRC transition!

        </p><p>To illustrate the problem, let’s assume that the device is on an
        HSPA+ network, which is configured to move from DCH to FACH state after
        10 seconds of radio inactivity. Next, we load an application that
        schedules an intermittent transfer, such as a real-time analytics
        beacon, on an 11-second interval. What’s the net result? The device may
        end up spending hundreds of milliseconds in data transfer and otherwise
        idle while in a high-power state. Worse, it would transition into the
        low-power state only to be woken up again a few hundred milliseconds
        later—worst-case scenario for latency and battery performance.

        </p><p>Every radio transmission, no matter how small, forces a transition
        to a high-power state. Then, once the transmission is done, the radio
        will remain in this high-power state until the inactivity timer has
        expired (<a data-type="xref" href="#energy-tail">Figure&nbsp;7-9</a>).
        The size of the actual data transfer does not influence the timer.
        Further, the device may then also have to cycle through several more
        intermediate states before it can return back to idle.

        <p>The "energy tails" generated by the timer-driven state transitions
        make periodic transfers a very inefficient network access pattern on
        mobile networks. First, you have to pay the latency cost of the state
        transition, then the transfer happens, and finally the radio idles,
        wasting power, until all the timers fire and the device can return to
        the low-power state.

          <p>AT&amp;T Labs Research published a great research paper
          ("Profiling Resource Usage for Mobile Applications") in which it
          analyzed a number of popular mobile applications for network and
          battery efficiency. Among these applications, Pandora serves as a
          great case study for the inefficiency of intermittent network
          transfers on mobile networks.

          </p><p>Whenever a Pandora user plays a song, the entire music file is
          streamed by the application from the network in one shot, which is
          the correct behavior: burst as much data as you can, then turn off
          the radio for as long as possible. However, following the music
          transfer, the application would conduct periodic audience
          measurements by sending intermittent analytics pings every 60
          seconds. The net effect? The analytics beacons accounted for 0.2% of

          significantly longer, unnecessarily wasting 46% of the battery. By
          coalescing the analytics data into fewer requests, or by sending the
          audience data when the radio is already active, we can eliminate the
          unnecessary energy tails and almost double the power efficiency of
          the application!

      Architecture</h2>

      <p>Now that we have familiarized ourselves with the RRC and device
      capabilities, it is useful to zoom out and consider the overall
      end-to-end architecture of a carrier network. Our goal here is not to
      become experts in the nomenclature and function of every component, of
      which there are dozens, but rather to highlight the components that have
      a direct impact on how the data flows through the carrier network and
      reasons why it may affect the performance of our applications.

      </p><p>The specific infrastructure and names of various logical and physical
      components within a carrier network depend on the generation and type of
      deployed network: EV-DO vs. HSPA vs. LTE, and so on. However, there are
      also many similarities among all of them, and in this chapter we’ll
      examine the high-level architecture of an LTE network.

      </p><p>Why LTE? First, it is the most likely architecture for new carrier
      deployments. Second, and even more importantly, one of the key features
      of LTE is its simplified architecture: fewer components and fewer
      dependencies also enable improved performance.

        <h3 id="radio-access-network-ran"><a href="#radio-access-network-ran" class="anchor">§</a>Radio Access Network (RAN)</h3>

        <p>The radio access network (RAN) is the first big logical component of
        every carrier network (<a data-type="xref" href="#lte-ran-network">Figure&nbsp;7-10</a>), whose primary responsibility
        is to mediate access to the provisioned radio channel and shuttle the
        data packets to and from the user’s device. In fact, this is the
        component controlled and mediated by the Radio Resource Controller. In
        LTE, each radio base station (eNodeB) hosts the RRC, which maintains
        the RRC state machine and performs all resource assignment for each
        active user in its cell.

        </p><figure id="lte-ran-network">
          <img src="0a9df9be8ccde8d1f7b59514f74cc63b.svg" alt="Figure 7-10. LTE radio access network: tracking cells and eNodeBs">

            tracking cells and eNodeBs
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Whenever a user has a stronger signal from a nearby cell, or if his
        current cell is overloaded, he may be handed off to a neighboring
        tower. However, while this sounds simple on paper, the hand-off
        procedure is also the reason for much of the additional complexity
        within every carrier network. If all users always remained in the same
        fixed position, and stayed within reach of a single tower, then a
        static routing topology would suffice. However, as we all know, that is
        simply not the case: users are mobile and must be migrated from tower
        to tower, and the migration process should not interrupt any voice or
        data traffic. Needless to say, this is a nontrivial problem.

        </p><p>First of all, if the user’s device can be associated with any radio
        tower, how do we know where to route the incoming packets? Of course,
        there is no magic: the radio access network must communicate with the
        core network to keep track of the location of every user. Further, to
        handle the transparent handoff, it must also be able to dynamically
        update its existing tunnels and routes without interrupting any
        existing, user-initiated voice and data sessions.

        </p><div data-type="note" id="id-xbtLSWcnuM">
          <p>In LTE, a tower-to-tower handoff can be performed within hundreds
          of milliseconds, which will yield a slight pause in data delivery at
          the physical layer, but otherwise this procedure is completely
          transparent to the user and to all applications running on her
          device. In earlier-generation networks, this same process can take up
          to several seconds.
        </p></div>

        <p>However, we’re not done yet. Radio handoffs can be a frequent
        occurrence, especially in high-density urban and office environments,
        and requiring the user’s device to continuously perform the cell
        handoff negotiations, even when the device is idle, would consume a lot
        of energy on the device. Hence, an additional layer of indirection was
        added: one or more radio towers are said to form a "tracking area,"
        which is a logical grouping of towers defined by the carrier network.

        </p><p>The core network must know the location of the user, but frequently
        it knows only the tracking area and not the specific tower currently
        servicing the user—as we will see, this has important implications on
        the latency of inbound data packets. In turn, the device is allowed to
        migrate between towers within the same tracking area with no overhead:
        if the device is in idle RRC state, no notifications are emitted by the
        device or the radio network, which saves energy on the mobile handset.

        <p>The core network (<a data-type="xref" href="#lte-core-network">Figure&nbsp;7-11</a>), which is also known as the
        Evolved Packet Core (EPC) in LTE is responsible for the data routing,
        accounting, and policy management. Put simply, it is the piece that
        connects the radio network to the public Internet.

        </p><figure id="lte-core-network">
          <img src="3a5cce13fbae63d778029e6fceb51acf.svg" alt="Figure 7-11. LTE core network (EPC): PGW, PCRF, SGW, and MME">

          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>First, we have the packet gateway (PGW), which is the public gateway
        that connects the mobile carrier to the public Internet. The PGW is the
        termination point for all external connections, regardless of the
        protocol. When a mobile device is connected to the carrier network, the
        IP address of the device is allocated and maintained by the PGW.

        </p><p>Each device within the carrier network has an internal identifier,
        which is independent of the assigned IP address. In turn, once a packet
        is received by the PGW, it is encapsulated and tunneled through the EPC
        to the radio access network. LTE uses Stream Control Transmission
        Protocol (SCTP) for control-plane traffic and a combination of GPRS
        Tunneling Protocol (GTP) and UDP for all other data.

        </p><aside>
          <h4 id="physical-layer-vs-application-layer-connectivity"><a href="#physical-layer-vs-application-layer-connectivity" class="anchor">§</a>Physical Layer vs. Application Layer Connectivity</h4>

          <p>The fact that the device IP address is allocated and maintained by
          the PGW has a number of important implications. First, it means that
          a wireless device can be easily associated with multiple IP
          addresses. Conversely, if the IP addresses are at a premium, then
          multiple devices can share the same IP address but be allocated
          different ports for outgoing and incoming traffic: the PGW acts as a
          NAT. In fact, the latter case is quite common. The same carrier IP
          address can be assigned to dozens, if not hundreds, of devices within
          its network.

          </p><p>Consequently, traffic from the same device may originate from
          multiple public carrier IP addresses. Don’t be surprised to see the
          same client request resources from different IPs! With IPv6, this
          behavior may change, and each device may finally get a unique IP
          address. Having said that, few carriers support IPv6 today, and the
          rollout and adoption of IPv6 remains very slow.

          </p><p>However, IP assignment aside, it is arguably even more important
          to recognize that because it is the PGW that terminates all
          connections, the device radio state is not tied to application layer
          connectivity: tearing down the radio context within the radio network
          terminates the physical radio link between the device and the radio
          tower, but this does not affect the state of any TCP or UDP sessions.
          The device radio can be idle, with no link to the local radio tower,
          while the established connections are maintained by the PGW.

          </p><p>Once application data must be delivered, the physical radio link
          is reestablished, and communication resumes with no side effects
          other than the incurred RRC negotiation delays required to
          reestablish the radio context.
        </p></aside>

        <p>The PGW also performs all the common policy enforcement, such as
        packet filtering and inspection, QoS assignment, DoS protection, and
        more. The Policy and Charging Rules Function (PCRF) component is
        responsible for maintaining and evaluating these rules for the packet
        gateway. PCRF is a logical component, meaning it can be part of the
        PGW, or it can stand on its own.

        </p><p>Now, let’s say the PGW has received a packet from the public
        Internet for one of the mobile devices on its network; where does it
        route the data? The PGW has no knowledge of the actual location of the
        user, nor the different tracking areas within the radio access network.
        This next step is the responsibility of the Serving Gateway (SGW) and
        the Mobility Management Entity (MME).

        </p><p>The PGW routes all of its packets to the SGW. However, to make
        matters even more complicated, the SGW may not know the exact location
        of the user either. This function is, in fact, one of the core
        responsibilities of the MME. The Mobility Management Entity component
        is effectively a user database, which manages all the state for every
        user on the network: their location on the network, type of account,
        billing status, enabled services, plus all other user metadata.
        Whenever a user’s location within the network changes, the location
        update is sent to the MME; when the user turns on their phone, the
        authentication is performed by the MME, and so on.

        </p><p>Hence, when a packet arrives at the SGW, a query to the MME is sent
        for the location of the user. Then, once the MME returns the answer,
        which contains the tracking area and the ID of the specific tower
        serving the target device, the SGW can establish a connection to the
        tower if none exists and route the user data to the radio access
        network.

        </p><p>In a nutshell, that is all there is to it. This high-level
        architecture is effectively the same in all the different generations
        of mobile data networks. The names of the logical components may
        differ, but fundamentally all mobile networks are subject to the
        following workflow:

        </p><ul>
          <li>
            <p>Data arrives at the external packet gateway, which connects the
            core network to the public Internet.

          </p></li><li>
            <p>A set of routing and packet policies is applied at the packet
            gateway.

          </p></li><li>
            <p>Data is routed from the public gateway to one or more serving
            gateways, which act as mobility anchors for the devices within the
            radio network.

          </p></li><li>
            <p>A user database service performs the authentication, billing,
            provisioning of services, and location tracking of each user on the
            network.

          </p></li><li>
            <p>Once the location of the user within the radio network is
            determined, the data is routed from the serving gateway to the
            appropriate radio tower.

          </p></li><li>
            <p>The radio tower performs the necessary resource assignment and
            negotiation with the target device and then delivers the data over
            the radio interface.
        </p></li></ul>

          Network</h4>

          <p>One of the main features of LTE is its new Evolved Packet Core
          (EPC) network, which is based on an IP-only architecture designed to
          carry both voice and data over the same, unified network. This design
          allows more cost-effective operation for the carrier but also places
          much stronger performance requirements on the network: voice requires
          low latency, and 4G speeds require much higher throughput.

          </p><p>How does the EPC achieve these goals? There are a large number of
          architectural improvements, but one of the primary differences to
          previous-generation networks is the simplified architecture of the
          LTE core network: some components were removed, others were collapsed
          into fewer logical components, and a lot of the decision making has
          been moved to the edges of the network.

          </p><p>For example, in LTE the RRC is maintained by the radio tower
          (eNodeB), whereas in earlier generations the RRC was managed higher
          up in the network (at the serving gateway), which imposed additional
          latency and performance bottlenecks on all control traffic within the
          network.

        and Latency</h3>

        <p>An important factor in the performance of any carrier network is the
        provisioned connectivity and capacity between all the logical and
        physical components. The LTE radio interface may be capable of reaching
        up to 100 Mbps between the user and the radio tower, but once the
        signal is received by the radio tower, sufficient capacity must be
        available to transport all this data through the carrier network and
        toward its actual destination. Plus, let’s not forget that a single
        tower should be able to service many active users simultaneously!

        </p><p>Delivering a true 4G experience is not a simple matter of deploying
        the new radio network. The core network must also be upgraded,
        sufficient capacity links must be present between the EPC and the radio
        network, and all the EPC components must be able to process much higher
        data rates with much lower latencies than in any previous generation
        network.

        </p><div data-type="note" id="id-xbtpT5hnuM">
          <p>In practice, a single radio tower may serve up to three nearby
          radio cells, which can easily add up to hundreds of active users.
          With 10+ Mbps data rate requirements per user, each tower needs a
          dedicated fiber link!
        </p></div>

        <p>Needless to say, all of these requirements make 4G networks a costly
        proposition to the carrier: running fiber to all the radio stations,
        high-performance routers, and so on. In practice, it is now not unusual
        to find the overall performance of the network being limited not by the
        radio interface, but by the available backhaul capacity of the carrier
        network.

        </p><p>These performance bottlenecks are not something we can control as
        developers of mobile applications, but they do, once again, illustrate
        an important fact: the architecture of our IP networks is based on a
        best effort delivery model, which makes no guarantees about end-to-end
        performance. Once we remove the bottleneck from the first hop, which is
        the wireless interface, we move the bottleneck to the next slowest link
        in the network, either within the carrier network or somewhere else on
        the path toward our destination. In fact, this is nothing new; recall
        our earlier discussion on <a data-type="xref" href="https://hpbn.co/primer-on-latency-and-bandwidth/#last-mile-latency">Last-Mile
        Latency</a> in wired networks.

        </p><p>Just because you are connected over a 4G interface doesn’t mean you
        are guaranteed the maximum throughput offered by the radio interface.
        Instead, our applications must adapt to the continuously changing
        network weather over the wireless channel, within the carrier network,
        and on the public Internet.

      <p>One of the primary complaints about designing applications for the
      mobile web is the high variability in latency. Well, now that we have
      covered the RRC and the high-level architecture of a mobile network, we
      can finally connect the dots and see the end-to-end flow of the data
      packets, which should also explain why this variability exists. Even
      better, as we will see, much of the variability is actually very much
      predictable!

      </p><section>
        <h3 id="initiating-a-request"><a href="#initiating-a-request" class="anchor">§</a>Initiating a Request</h3>

        <p>To start, let’s assume that the user has already authenticated with
        a 4G network and the mobile device is idle. Next, the user types in a
        URL and hits "Go." What happens next?

        </p><p>First, because the phone is in idle RRC state, the radio must
        synchronize with the nearby radio tower and send a request for a new
        radio context to be established (<a data-type="xref" href="#lte-request">Figure&nbsp;7-12</a>, step 1)—this negotiation requires
        several roundtrips between the handset and the radio tower, which may
        take up to 100 milliseconds. For earlier-generation networks, where the
        RRC is managed by the serving gateway, this negotiation latency is much
        higher—up to several seconds.

        </p><p>Once the radio context is established, the device has a resource
        assignment from the radio tower and is able to transmit data (step 2)
        at a specified rate and signal power. The time to transmit a packet of
        data from the user’s radio to the tower is known as the "user-plane
        one-way latency" and takes up to five milliseconds for 4G networks.
        Hence, the first packet incurs a much higher delay due to the need to
        perform the RRC transition, but packets immediately after incur only
        the constant first-hop latency cost, as long as the radio stays in the
        high-power state.

        </p><figure id="lte-request">

        <p>However, we are not done yet, as we have only transferred our
        packets from the device to the radio tower! From here, the packets have
        to travel through the core network—through the SGW to the PGW (step
        3)—and out to the public Internet (step 4). Unfortunately, the 4G
        standards make no guarantees on latency of this path, and hence this
        latency will vary from carrier to carrier.

          tends to be in the 30–100 ms range once the device is in a connected
          state—that is to say, without the control plane latency incurred by
          the initial packet. Hence, if up to 5 ms of the total time is
          accounted for on the first wireless hop, then the rest (25–95 ms) is
          the routing and transit overhead within the core network of the
          carrier.
        </p></div>

        <p>Next, let’s say the browser has fetched the requested page and the
        user is engaging with the content. The radio has been idle for a few
        dozen seconds, which means that the RRC has likely moved the user into
        a DRX state (<a data-type="xref" href="#lte-rrc-state-machine">LTE RRC
        State Machine</a>) to conserve battery power and to free up network
        resources for other users. At this point, the user decides to navigate
        to a different destination in the browser and hence triggers a new
        request. What happens now?

        </p><p>Nearly the same workflow is repeated as we just saw, except that
        because the device was in a dormant (DRX) state, a slightly quicker
        negotiation (<a data-type="xref" href="#lte-request">Figure&nbsp;7-12</a>, step 1) can take place between the
        device and the radio tower—up to 50 milliseconds (<a data-type="xref" href="#lte-rrc-latency">Table&nbsp;7-9</a>) for dormant to connected.

        </p><p>In summary, a user initiating a new request incurs several different
        latencies:

        </p><dl>
          <dt>Control-plane latency

          </dt><dd>
            <p>Fixed, one-time latency cost incurred for RRC negotiation and
            state transitions: &lt;100 ms for idle to active, and &lt;50 ms for
            dormant to active.

          </p></dd><dt>User-plane latency

          </dt><dd>
            <p>Fixed cost for every application packet transferred between the
            device and the radio tower: &lt;5 ms.

          </p></dd><dt>Core network latency

          </dt><dd>
            <p>Carrier dependent cost for transporting the packet from the
            radio tower to the packet gateway: in practice, 30–100 ms.

          </p></dd><dt>Internet routing latency

          </dt><dd>
            <p>Variable latency cost between the carrier’s packet gateway and
            the destination address on the public Internet.
        </p></dd></dl>

        <p>The first two latencies are bounded by the 4G requirements, the core
        network latency is carrier specific, and the final piece is something
        you can influence by strategically positioning your servers closer to
        the user; see the earlier discussion on <a data-type="xref" href="https://hpbn.co/primer-on-latency-and-bandwidth/#speed-of-light-and-propagation-latency">
        Speed of Light and Propagation Latency</a>.

          <h4 id="latency-and-jitter-in-mobile-networks"><a href="#latency-and-jitter-in-mobile-networks" class="anchor">§</a>Latency
          and Jitter in Mobile Networks</h4>

          <p>One frequently shared complaint about mobile networks is the
          variability, or jitter, in packet latency. And it is certainly true
          that there are many contributing components that can impact latency.
          However, once you factor in the control plane cost for RRC state
          transitions incurred by the first packet, you will likely find that
          the performance is, in fact, much more predictable than you would
          otherwise expect.

          </p><p>In LTE, the control plane overhead is up to 100 milliseconds. With
          LTE-Advanced, this number is further lowered to 50 milliseconds.
          However, in earlier-generation networks, this same negotiation can
          take seconds!

          </p><p>Core network routing latency is the second, and often very large,
          contributing factor to the overall packet latency in mobile networks.
          The specific delays incurred within the core network vary by
          generation of the network, as well as the specific infrastructure
          deployed by the carrier. However, while few carriers openly advertise
          their latency performance—perhaps because it is nothing to be proud
          of—it usually can be found in their technical FAQs.

          </p><p>For example, AT&amp;T, which is the largest mobile provider in the
          U.S., sets the following expectations, which are typical for the
          industry at large, for core network latency for the various
          generations within its network:

          miles, which takes 133.7 ms for light to travel. In other words, it

          requiring, on average, at least one trip around the globe!

        <h3 id="inbound-data-flow"><a href="#inbound-data-flow" class="anchor">§</a>Inbound Data Flow</h3>

        <p>Now let’s examine the opposite scenario: the user’s device is idle,
        but a data packet must be routed from the PGW to the user
        (<a data-type="xref" href="#lte-notification">Figure&nbsp;7-13</a>).
        Once again, recall that all connections are terminated at the PGW,
        which means that the device can be idle, with its radio off, but the
        connection the device may have established earlier, such as a
        long-lived TCP session, can still be active at the PGW.

        </p><figure id="lte-notification">
          <img src="0220cddf71377e3527a891fc7730625e.svg" alt="Figure 7-13. LTE inbound data flow latencies">

            latencies
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>As we saw earlier, the PGW routes the inbound packet to the SGW
        (step 1), which in turn queries the MME. However, the MME may not know
        the exact tower currently servicing the user; recall that a collection
        of radio towers form a "tracking area." Whenever a user enters a
        different tracking area, its location is updated in the MME, but tower
        handoffs within the same tracking area do not trigger an update to the
        MME.

        </p><p>Instead, if the device is idle, the MME sends a paging message (step
        2) to all the towers in the tracking area, which in turn all broadcast
        a notification (step 3) on a shared radio channel, indicating that the
        device should reestablish its radio context to receive the inbound
        data. The device periodically wakes to listen to the paging messages,
        and if it finds itself on the paging list, then it initiates the
        negotiation (step 4) with the radio tower to reestablish the radio
        context.

        </p><p>Once the radio context is established, the tower that performed the
        negotiation sends a message back (step 5) to the MME indicating where
        the user is, the MME returns the answer to the serving gateway, and the
        gateway finally routes the message (step 6) to the tower, which then
        delivers (step 7) the message to the device! Phew.

        </p><p>Once the device is in a connected state, a direct tunnel is
        established between the radio tower and the serving gateway, which
        means that further incoming packets are routed directly to the tower
        without the paging overhead, skipping steps 2–5. Once again, the first
        packet incurs a much higher latency cost on mobile networks! Plan for
        it.

        </p><div data-type="note" id="id-yvtau5TGCQ">
          <p>The preceding packet workflow is transparent to IP and all layers
          above it, including our applications: the packets are buffered by the
          PGW, SGW, and the eNodeB at each stage until they can be routed to
          the device. In practice, this translates to observable latency jitter
          in packet arrival times, with the first packet incurring the highest
          delays due to control-plane negotiation.

      <h2 id="heterogeneous-networks-hetnets"><a href="#heterogeneous-networks-hetnets" class="anchor">§</a>Heterogeneous
      Networks (HetNets)</h2>

      <p>Existing 4G radio and modulation technologies are already within reach
      of the theoretical limits of the wireless channel. Hence, the next order
      of magnitude in wireless performance will not come from improvements in
      the radio interfaces, but rather from smarter topologies of the wireless
      networks—specifically, through wide deployment of multilayer
      heterogeneous networks (HetNets), which will also require many
      improvements in the intra-cell coordination, handoff, and interference
      management.

      </p><p>The core idea behind HetNets is a simple one: instead of relying on
      just the macro coverage of a large geographic area, which creates a lot
      of competition for all users, we can also cover the area with many small
      cells (<a data-type="xref" href="#hetnet">Figure&nbsp;7-14</a>), each of
      which can minimize path loss, require lower transmit power, and enable
      better performance for all users.

      </p><figure id="hetnet">

      <p>A single macrocell can cover up to tens of square miles in low-density
      wireless environments, but in practice, in high-density urban and office
      settings, can be limited to anywhere from just 50 to 300 meters! In other
      words, it can cover a small block, or a few buildings. By comparison,
      microcells are designed to cover a specific building; picocells can
      service one or more separate floors, and femtocells can cover a small
      apartment and leverage your existing broadband service as the wireless
      backhaul.

      </p><p>However, note that HetNets are not simply replacing the macrocells
      with many small cells. Instead, HetNets are layering multiple cells on
      top of one another! By deploying overlapping layers of wireless networks,
      HetNets can provide much better network capacity and improved coverage
      for all users. However, the outstanding challenges are in minimizing
      interference, providing sufficient uplink capacity, and creating and
      improving protocols for seamless handoff between the various layers of
      networks.

      </p><p>What does this mean for the developers building mobile applications?
      Expect the number of handoffs between different cells to increase
      significantly and adapt accordingly: the latency and throughput
      performance may vary significantly.

        <p>Picocells are often used by mobile carriers to extend coverage to
        indoor and outdoor areas where signal quality may be poor, or to add
        network capacity in areas with very dense phone usage—e.g., a large
        public area, a conference hall, stadium, train station, and so on. Some
        picocells may be deployed permanently, while others may be put up for a
        specific occasion: wireless capacity planning and modeling
        (<a data-type="xref" href="#wireless-planning">Figure&nbsp;7-15</a>) is
        both an art and a science!

      3G, 4G, and WiFi Performance</h2>

      <p>By this point, one has to wonder whether all the extra protocols,
      gateways, and negotiation mechanisms within a 3G or 4G network are worth
      the additional complexity. By comparison, WiFi implementation is much
      simpler and seems to work well enough, doesn’t it? Answering this
      question requires a lot of caveats, since as we saw, measuring wireless
      performance is subject to dozens of environmental and technology
      considerations. Further, the answer also depends on chosen evaluation
      criteria:

      </p><ul>
        <li>
          <p>Importance of battery performance vs. network performance.

        </p></li><li>
          <p>Per user and network-wide throughput performance.

        </p></li><li>
          <p>Latency and packet jitter performance.

        </p></li><li>
          <p>Cost and feasibility of deployment.

        </p></li><li>
          <p>Ability to meet government and policy requirements.

        </p></li><li>
          <p>And dozens of other and similar criteria…
      </p></li></ul>

      <p>However, while there are dozens of different stakeholders (users,
      carriers, and handset manufacturers, just to name a few), each with their
      own priority lists, early tests of the new 4G networks are showing very
      promising results. In fact, key metrics such as network latency,
      throughput, and network capacity are often outperforming WiFi!

      </p><p>As a concrete example, a joint research project between the University
      of Michigan and AT&amp;T Labs ran a country-wide test (<a data-type="xref" href="#mobiperf">Figure&nbsp;7-16</a>) within the U.S., comparing
      4G, 3G, and WiFi (802.11g, 2.4GHz) performance:

      </p><ul>
        <li>
          <p>Performance measurements were done against 46 distinct Measurement
          Lab nodes, which is an open platform for Internet measurement tools,
          and via the MobiPerf open-source measurement client.

        </p></li><li>
          <p>Measurements were done over a period of two months in late 2011 by
          3,300 users.
      </p></li></ul>

      <figure id="mobiperf">
        <img src="52d5ea44c0ddf990c5296ed2f69f3842.png" alt="Figure 7-16. Test result analysis of WiFi, LTE, and 3G performance">

      </figure>

      <div data-type="note" id="id-o1tYuAFl">
        <p>The box-and-whisker plot for each connection type packs a lot of
        useful information into a small graphic: the whiskers show the range of
        the entire distribution, the box shows the 25%–75% quantiles of the
        distribution, and the black horizontal line within the box is the
        median.
      </p></div>

      <p>Of course, a single test does not prove a universal rule, especially
      when it comes to performance, but the results are nonetheless very
      promising: early LTE networks are showing great network throughput
      performance, and even more impressively, much more stable RTT and packet
      jitter latencies when compared with other wireless standards.

      </p><p>In other words, at least with respect to this test, LTE offers
      comparable and better performance than WiFi, which also shows that
      improved performance is possible, and all the extra complexity is paying
      off! The mobile web doesn’t have to be slow. In fact, we have all the
      reasons to believe that we can and will make it faster.
