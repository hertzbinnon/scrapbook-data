      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>User Datagram Protocol, or UDP, was added to the core network protocol
      suite in August of 1980 by Jon Postel, well after the original
      introduction of TCP/IP, but right at the time when the TCP and IP
      specifications were being split to become two separate RFCs. This timing
      is important because, as we will see, the primary feature and appeal of
      UDP is not in what it introduces, but rather in all the features it
      chooses to omit. UDP is colloquially referred to as a <em>null
      protocol</em>, and RFC 768, which describes its operation, could indeed
      fit on a napkin.

      </p><dl>
        <dt>Datagram

        </dt><dd>
          <p>A self-contained, independent entity of data carrying sufficient
          information to be routed from the source to the destination nodes
          without reliance on earlier exchanges between the nodes and the
          transporting network.
      </p></dd></dl>

      <p>The words datagram and packet are often used interchangeably, but
      there are some nuances. While the term "packet" applies to any formatted
      block of data, the term "datagram" is often reserved for packets
      delivered via an unreliable service—no delivery guarantees, no failure
      notifications. Because of this, you will frequently find the more
      descriptive term "Unreliable" substituted for the official term "User" in
      the UDP acronym, to form "Unreliable Datagram Protocol." That is also why
      UDP packets are generally, and more correctly, referred to as datagrams.

      </p><p>Perhaps the most well-known use of UDP, and one that every browser and
      Internet application depends on, is the Domain Name System (DNS): given a
      human-friendly computer hostname, we need to discover its IP address
      before any data exchange can occur. However, even though the browser
      itself is dependent on UDP, historically the protocol has never been
      exposed as a first-class transport for pages and applications running
      within it. That is, until WebRTC entered into the picture.

      </p><p>The new Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) standards, jointly
      developed by the IETF and W3C working groups, are enabling real-time
      communication, such as voice and video calling and other forms of
      peer-to-peer (P2P) communication, natively within the browser via UDP.
      With WebRTC, UDP is now a first-class browser transport with a
      client-side API! We will investigate WebRTC in-depth in <a data-type="xref" href="https://hpbn.co/webrtc/">WebRTC</a>, but before we get there, let’s first
      explore the inner workings of the UDP protocol to understand why and
      where we may want to use it.
    </p></section>

    <section>
      <h2 id="null-protocol-services"><a href="#null-protocol-services" class="anchor">§</a>Null Protocol Services</h2>

      <p>To understand UDP and why it is commonly referred to as a "null
      protocol," we first need to look at the Internet Protocol (IP), which is
      located one layer below both TCP and UDP protocols.

      </p><p>The IP layer has the primary task of delivering datagrams from the
      source to the destination host based on their addresses. To do so, the
      messages are encapsulated within an IP packet (<a data-type="xref" href="#ip-header">Figure&nbsp;3-1</a>) which identifies the source and the
      destination addresses, as well as a number of other routing parameters .

      </p><p>Once again, the word "datagram" is an important distinction: the IP
      layer provides no guarantees about message delivery or notifications of
      failure and hence directly exposes the unreliability of the underlying
      network to the layers above it. If a routing node along the way drops the
      IP packet due to congestion, high load, or for other reasons, then it is
      the responsibility of a protocol above IP to detect it, recover, and
      retransmit the data—that is, if that is the desired behavior!

      </p><figure id="ip-header">
        <img src="2aaa8d11ee7fd2d8a332e6dc68dc50ae.svg" alt="Figure 3-1. IPv4 header (20 bytes)">

        <figcaption>
          <span class="label">Figure 3-1.</span> IPv4 header (20 bytes)
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>The UDP protocol encapsulates user messages into its own packet
      structure (<a data-type="xref" href="#udp-header">Figure&nbsp;3-2</a>),
      which adds only four additional fields: source port, destination port,
      length of packet, and checksum. Thus, when IP delivers the packet to the
      destination host, the host is able to unwrap the UDP packet, identify the
      target application by the destination port, and deliver the message.
      Nothing more, nothing less.

      </p><figure id="udp-header">
        <img src="e0661f06a9fae1f5346d0efb57178146.svg" alt="Figure 3-2. UDP header (8 bytes)">

        <figcaption>
          <span class="label">Figure 3-2.</span> UDP header (8 bytes)
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>In fact, both the source port and the checksum fields are optional
      fields in UDP datagrams. The IP packet contains its own header checksum,
      and the application can choose to omit the UDP checksum, which means that
      all the error detection and error correction can be delegated to the
      applications above them. At its core, UDP simply provides "application
      multiplexing" on top of IP by embedding the source and the target
      application ports of the communicating hosts. With that in mind, we can
      now summarize all the UDP non-services:

      </p><dl>
        <dt>No guarantee of message delivery

        </dt><dd>
          <p>No acknowledgments, retransmissions, or timeouts

        </p></dd><dt>No guarantee of order of delivery

        </dt><dd>
          <p>No packet sequence numbers, no reordering, no head-of-line
          blocking

        </p></dd><dt>No connection state tracking

        </dt><dd>
          <p>No connection establishment or teardown state machines

        </p></dd><dt>No congestion control

        </dt><dd>
          <p>No built-in client or network feedback mechanisms
      </p></dd></dl>

      <p>TCP is a byte-stream oriented protocol capable of transmitting
      application messages spread across multiple packets without any explicit
      message boundaries within the packets themselves. To achieve this,
      connection state is allocated on both ends of the connection, and each
      packet is sequenced, retransmitted when lost, and delivered in order. UDP
      datagrams, on the other hand, have definitive boundaries: each datagram
      is carried in a single IP packet, and each application read yields the
      full message; datagrams cannot be fragmented.

      </p><p>UDP is a simple, stateless protocol, suitable for bootstrapping other
      application protocols on top: virtually all of the protocol design
      decisions are left to the application above it. However, before you run
      away to implement your own protocol to replace TCP, you should think
      carefully about complications such as UDP interaction with the many
      layers of deployed middleboxes (NAT traversal), as well as general
      network protocol design best practices. Without careful engineering and
      planning, it is not uncommon to start with a bright idea for a new
      protocol but end up with a poorly implemented version of TCP. The
      algorithms and the state machines in TCP have been honed and improved
      over decades and have taken into account dozens of mechanisms that are
      anything but easy to replicate well.

      <h2 id="udp-and-network-address-translators"><a href="#udp-and-network-address-translators" class="anchor">§</a>UDP and
      Network Address Translators</h2>

      <p>Unfortunately, IPv4 addresses are only 32 bits long, which provides a
      maximum of 4.29 billion unique IP addresses. The IP Network Address
      Translator (NAT) specification was introduced in mid-1994 (RFC 1631) as
      an interim solution to resolve the looming IPv4 address depletion
      problem—as the number of hosts on the Internet began to grow
      exponentially in the early '90s, we could not expect to allocate a unique
      IP to every host.

      </p><p>The proposed IP reuse solution was to introduce NAT devices at the
      edge of the network, each of which would be responsible for maintaining a
      table mapping of local IP and port tuples to one or more globally unique
      (public) IP and port tuples (<a data-type="xref" href="#nat-table">Figure&nbsp;3-3</a>). The local IP address space behind the
      translator could then be reused among many different networks, thus
      solving the address depletion problem.

          <span class="label">Figure 3-3.</span> IP Network Address Translator
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>Unfortunately, as it often happens, there is nothing more permanent
      than a temporary solution. Not only did the NAT devices resolve the
      immediate problem, but they also quickly became a ubiquitous component of
      many corporate and home proxies and routers, security appliances,
      firewalls, and dozens of other hardware and software devices. NAT
      middleboxes are no longer a temporary solution; rather, they have become
      an ossified part of the Internet infrastructure.

        <p>One or all of the preceding ranges should look familiar. Chances
        are, your local router has assigned your computer an IP address from
        one of those ranges. That’s your private IP address on the internal
        network, which is then translated by the NAT device when communicating
        with an outside network.

        </p><p>To avoid routing errors and confusion, no public computer is allowed
        to be assigned an IP address from any of these reserved private network
        ranges.

      <section>
        <h3 id="connection-state-timeouts"><a href="#connection-state-timeouts" class="anchor">§</a>Connection-State Timeouts</h3>

        <p>The issue with NAT translation, at least as far as UDP is concerned,
        is precisely the routing table that it must maintain to deliver the
        datagrams. NAT middleboxes rely on connection state, whereas UDP has
        none. This is a fundamental mismatch and a source of many problems for
        delivering UDP datagrams. Further, it is now not uncommon for a client
        to be behind many layers of NATs, which only complicates matters
        further.

        </p><p>Each TCP connection has a well-defined protocol state machine, which
        begins with a handshake, followed by application data transfer, and a
        well-defined exchange to close the connection. Given this flow, each
        middlebox can observe the state of the connection and create and remove
        the routing entries as needed. With UDP, there is no handshake or
        connection termination, and hence there is no connection state machine
        to monitor.

        </p><p>Delivering outbound UDP traffic does not require any extra work, but
        routing a reply requires that we have an entry in the translation
        table, which will tell us the IP and port of the local destination
        host. Thus, translators have to keep state about each UDP flow, which
        itself is stateless.

        </p><p>Even worse, the translator is also tasked with figuring out when to
        drop the translation record, but since UDP has no connection
        termination sequence, either peer could just stop transmitting
        datagrams at any point without notice. To address this, UDP routing
        records are expired on a timer. How often? There is no definitive
        answer; instead the timeout depends on the vendor, make, version, and
        configuration of the translator. Consequently, one of the de facto best
        practices for long-running sessions over UDP is to introduce
        bidirectional keepalive packets to periodically reset the timers for
        the translation records in all the NAT devices along the path.

        </p><aside>
          <h4 id="tcp-timeouts-and-nats"><a href="#tcp-timeouts-and-nats" class="anchor">§</a>TCP Timeouts and NATs</h4>

          <p>Technically, there is no need for additional TCP timeouts on NAT
          devices. The TCP protocol follows a well-defined handshake and
          termination sequence, which signals when the appropriate translation
          records can be added and removed.

          </p><p>Unfortunately, in practice, many NAT devices apply similar timeout
          logic both to TCP and UDP sessions. As a result, in some cases
          bidirectional keepalive packets are also required for TCP. If your
          TCP connections are getting dropped, then there is a good chance that
          an intermediate NAT timeout is to blame.
        </p></aside>

      <section>
        <h3 id="nat-traversal"><a href="#nat-traversal" class="anchor">§</a>NAT
        Traversal</h3>

        <p>Unpredictable connection state handling is a serious issue created
        by NATs, but an even larger problem for many applications is the
        inability to establish a UDP connection at all. This is especially true
        for P2P applications, such as VoIP, games, and file sharing, which
        often need to act as both client and server to enable two-way direct
        communication between the peers.

        </p><p>The first issue is that in the presence of a NAT, the internal
        client is unaware of its public IP: it knows its internal IP address,
        and the NAT devices perform the rewriting of the source port and
        address in every UDP packet, as well as the originating IP address
        within the IP packet. However, if the client communicates its private
        IP address as part of its application data with a peer outside of its
        private network, then the connection will inevitably fail. Hence, the
        promise of "transparent" translation is no longer true, and the
        application must first discover its public IP address if it needs to
        share it with a peer outside its private network.

        </p><p>However, knowing the public IP is also not sufficient to
        successfully transmit with UDP. Any packet that arrives at the public
        IP of a NAT device must also have a destination port and an entry in
        the NAT table that can translate it to an internal destination host IP
        and port tuple. If this entry does not exist, which is the most likely
        case if someone simply tries to transmit data from the public network,
        then the packet is simply dropped (<a data-type="xref" href="#nat-firewall">Figure&nbsp;3-4</a>). The NAT device acts as a simple
        packet filter since it has no way to automatically determine the
        internal route, unless explicitly configured by the user through a
        port-forwarding or similar mechanism.

        </p><figure id="nat-firewall">
          <img src="44b1b32df5642e4f8f9c29e901020fbc.svg" alt="Figure 3-4. Dropped inbound packet due to missing mapping">

            <span class="label">Figure 3-4.</span> Dropped inbound packet due
            to missing mapping
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>It is important to note that the preceding behavior is not an issue
        for client applications, which begin their interaction from the
        internal network and in the process establish the necessary translation
        records along the path. However, handling inbound connections (acting
        as a server) from P2P applications such as VoIP, game consoles, file
        sharing, and so on, in the presence of a NAT, is where we will
        immediately run into this problem.

        </p><p>To work around this mismatch in UDP and NATs, various traversal
        techniques (TURN, STUN, ICE) have to be used to establish end-to-end
        connectivity between the UDP peers on both sides.

        <h3 id="stun-turn-and-ice"><a href="#stun-turn-and-ice" class="anchor">§</a>STUN, TURN, and ICE</h3>

        <p>Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) is a protocol (RFC 5389)
        that allows the host application to discover the presence of a network
        address translator on the network, and when present to obtain the
        allocated public IP and port tuple for the current connection
        (<a data-type="xref" href="#stun">Figure&nbsp;3-5</a>). To do so, the
        protocol requires assistance from a well-known, third-party STUN server
        that must reside on the public network.

        </p><figure id="stun">
          <img src="6c3d168f45e9a1b2965f790c5cd794f0.svg" alt="Figure 3-5. STUN query for public IP and port">

            port
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Assuming the IP address of the STUN server is known (through DNS
        discovery, or through a manually specified address), the application
        first sends a binding request to the STUN server. In turn, the STUN
        server replies with a response that contains the public IP address and
        port of the client as seen from the public network. This simple
        workflow addresses several problems we encountered in our earlier
        discussion:

            then able to use this information as part of its application data
            when communicating with its peers.

          </p></li><li>
            <p>The outbound binding request to the STUN server establishes NAT
            routing entries along the path, such that the inbound packets
            arriving at the public IP and port tuple can now find their way
            back to the host application on the internal network.

          </p></li><li>
            <p>The STUN protocol defines a simple mechanism for keepalive pings
            to keep the NAT routing entries from timing out.
        </p></li></ul>

        <p>With this mechanism in place, whenever two peers want to talk to
        each other over UDP, they will first send binding requests to their
        respective STUN servers, and following a successful response on both
        sides, they can then use the established public IP and port tuples to
        exchange data.

        </p><p>However, in practice, STUN is not sufficient to deal with all NAT
        topologies and network configurations. Further, unfortunately, in some
        cases UDP may be blocked altogether by a firewall or some other network
        appliance—not an uncommon scenario for many enterprise networks. To
        address this issue, whenever STUN fails, we can use the Traversal Using
        Relays around NAT (TURN) protocol (RFC 5766) as a fallback, which can
        run over UDP and switch to TCP if all else fails.

        </p><p>The key word in TURN is, of course, "relays." The protocol relies on
        the presence and availability of a public relay (<a data-type="xref" href="#turn">Figure&nbsp;3-6</a>) to shuttle the data between the
        peers.

        </p><figure id="turn">

        </figure>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Both clients begin their connections by sending an allocate
            request to the same TURN server, followed by permissions
            negotiation.

          </p></li><li>
            <p>Once the negotiation is complete, both peers communicate by
            sending their data to the TURN server, which then relays it to the
            other peer.
        </p></li></ul>

        <p>Of course, the obvious downside in this exchange is that it is no
        longer peer-to-peer! TURN is the most reliable way to provide
        connectivity between any two peers on any networks, but it carries a
        very high cost of operating the TURN server—at the very least, the
        relay must have enough capacity to service all the data flows. As a
        result, TURN is best used as a last resort fallback for cases where
        direct connectivity fails.

          Practice</h4>

          <p>Google’s libjingle is an open-source C++ library for building
          peer-to-peer applications, which takes care of STUN, TURN, and ICE
          negotiations under the hood. The library is used to power the Google
          Talk chat application, and the documentation provides a valuable
          reference point for performance of STUN vs. TURN in the real world:

          </p><ul>
            <li>
              <p>92% of the time the connection can take place directly (STUN).

            </p></li><li>
              <p>8% of the time the connection requires a relay (TURN).
          </p></li></ul>

          <p>Unfortunately, even with STUN, a significant fraction of users are
          unable to establish a direct P2P tunnel. To provide a reliable
          service, we also need TURN relays, which can acts as a fallback for
          cases where direct P2P communication is not an option.
        </p></aside>

        <p>Building an effective NAT traversal solution is not for the faint of
        heart. Thankfully, we can lean on Interactive Connectivity
        Establishment (ICE) protocol (RFC 5245) to help with this task. ICE is
        a protocol, and a set of methods, that seek to establish the most
        efficient tunnel between the participants (<a data-type="xref" href="#ice">Figure&nbsp;3-7</a>): direct connection where possible,
        leveraging STUN negotiation where needed, and finally fallback to TURN
        if all else fails.

        <p>In practice, if you are building a P2P application over UDP, then
        you most definitely want to leverage an existing platform API, or a
        third-party library that implements ICE, STUN, and TURN for you. And
        now that you are familiar with what each of these protocols does, you
        can navigate your way through the required setup and configuration!

      <p>UDP is a simple and a commonly used protocol for bootstrapping new
      transport protocols. In fact, the primary feature of UDP is all the
      features it omits: no connection state, handshakes, retransmissions,
      reassembly, reordering, congestion control, congestion avoidance, flow
      control, or even optional error checking. However, the flexibility that
      this minimal message-oriented transport layer affords is also a liability
      for the implementer. Your application will likely have to reimplement
      some, or many, of these features from scratch, and each must be designed
      to play well with other peers and protocols on the network.

      </p><p>Unlike TCP, which ships with built-in flow and congestion control and
      congestion avoidance, UDP applications must implement these mechanisms on
      their own. Congestion insensitive UDP applications can easily overwhelm
      the network, which can lead to degraded network performance and, in
      severe cases, to network congestion collapse.

      </p><p>If you want to leverage UDP for your own application, make sure to
      research and read the current best practices and recommendations. One
      such document is the RFC 5405, which specifically focuses on design
      guidelines for applications delivered via unicast UDP. Here is a short
      sample of the recommendations:

      </p><ul>
        <li>
          <p>Application <em>must</em> tolerate a wide range of Internet path
          conditions.

        </p></li><li>
          <p>Application <em>should</em> control rate of transmission.

        </p></li><li>
          <p>Application <em>should</em> perform congestion control over all
          traffic.

        </p></li><li>
          <p>Application <em>should</em> use bandwidth similar to TCP.

        </p></li><li>
          <p>Application <em>should</em> back off retransmission counters
          following loss.

        </p></li><li>
          <p>Application <em>should not</em> send datagrams that exceed path
          MTU.

        </p></li><li>
          <p>Application <em>should</em> handle datagram loss, duplication, and
          reordering.

        </p></li><li>
          <p>Application <em>should</em> be robust to delivery delays up to 2
          minutes.

        </p></li><li>
          <p>Application <em>should</em> enable IPv4 UDP checksum, and
          <em>must</em> enable IPv6 checksum.

        </p></li><li>
          <p>Application <em>may</em> use keepalives when needed (minimum
          interval 15 seconds).
      </p></li></ul>

      <p>Designing a new transport protocol requires a lot of careful thought,
      planning, and research—do your due diligence. Where possible, leverage an
      existing library or a framework that has already taken into account NAT
      traversal, and is able to establish some degree of fairness with other
      sources of concurrent network traffic.

      </p><p>On that note, good news: WebRTC (<a data-type="xref" href="https://hpbn.co/webrtc/">WebRTC</a>) is just such a framework!
