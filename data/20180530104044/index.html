  <article data-type="chapter" id="TCP">
    <section id="introduction">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>At the heart of the Internet are two protocols, IP and TCP. The IP, or
      Internet Protocol, is what provides the host-to-host routing and
      addressing, and TCP, or Transmission Control Protocol, is what provides
      the abstraction of a reliable network running over an unreliable channel.
      TCP/IP is also commonly referred to as the Internet Protocol Suite and
      was first proposed by Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn in their 1974 paper titled
      "A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication."

      </p><p>The original proposal (RFC 675) was revised several times, and in 1981
      the v4 specification of TCP/IP was published not as one, but as two
      separate RFCs:

      </p><ul>
        <li>
          <p>RFC 791 — Internet Protocol

        </p></li><li>
          <p>RFC 793 — Transmission Control Protocol
      </p></li></ul>

      <p>Since then, there have been a number of enhancements proposed and made
      to TCP, but the core operation has not changed significantly. TCP quickly
      replaced previous protocols and is now the protocol of choice for many of
      the most popular applications: World Wide Web, email, file transfers, and
      many others.

      </p><p>TCP provides an effective abstraction of a reliable network running
      over an unreliable channel, hiding most of the complexity of network
      communication from our applications: retransmission of lost data,
      in-order delivery, congestion control and avoidance, data integrity, and
      more. When you work with a TCP stream, you are guaranteed that all bytes
      sent will be identical with bytes received and that they will arrive in
      the same order to the client. As such, TCP is optimized for accurate
      delivery, rather than a timely one. This, as it turns out, also creates
      some challenges when it comes to optimizing for web performance in the
      browser.

      </p><p>The HTTP standard does not mandate TCP as the only transport protocol.
      If we wanted, we could deliver HTTP via a datagram socket (User Datagram
      Protocol or UDP), or any other transport protocol of our choice, but in
      practice all HTTP traffic on the Internet today is delivered via TCP due
      to the many great and convenient features it provides out of the box.

      </p><p>Because of this, understanding some of the core mechanisms of TCP is
      essential knowledge for building an optimized web experience. Chances are
      you won’t be working with TCP sockets directly in your application, but
      the design choices you make at the application layer will dictate the
      performance of TCP and the underlying network over which your application
      is delivered.

        <p>We are all familiar with IPv4 and IPv6, but what happened to
        IPv{1,2,3,5}? The 4 in IPv4 stands for the version 4 of the TCP/IP
        protocol, which was published in September 1981. The original TCP/IP
        proposal coupled the two protocols, and it was the v4 draft that
        officially split the two into separate RFCs. Hence, the v4 in IPv4 is a
        heritage of its relationship to TCP: there are no standalone IPv1,
        IPv2, or IPv3 protocols.

        </p><p>When the working group began work on "Internet Protocol next
        generation" (IPng) in 1994, a new version number was needed, but v5 was
        already assigned to another experimental protocol: Internet Stream
        Protocol (ST). As it turns out, ST never took off, which is why few
        ever heard of it. Hence the 6 in IPv6.

      <h2 id="three-way-handshake"><a href="#three-way-handshake" class="anchor">§</a>Three-Way Handshake</h2>

      <p>All TCP connections begin with a three-way handshake (<a data-type="xref" href="#handshake">Figure&nbsp;2-1</a>). Before the client or the
      server can exchange any application data, they must agree on starting
      packet sequence numbers, as well as a number of other connection specific
      variables, from both sides. The sequence numbers are picked randomly from
      both sides for security reasons.

      </p><dl>
        <dt>SYN

        </dt><dd>
          <p>Client picks a random sequence number <code>x</code> and sends a
          SYN packet, which may also include additional TCP flags and options.

        </p></dd><dt>SYN ACK

        </dt><dd>
          <p>Server increments <code>x</code> by one, picks own random sequence
          number <code>y</code>, appends its own set of flags and options, and
          dispatches the response.

        </p></dd><dt>ACK

        </dt><dd>
          <p>Client increments both <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> by one
          and completes the handshake by dispatching the last ACK packet in the
          handshake.
      </p></dd></dl>

      <figure id="handshake">
        <img src="eefa1170a673da0140efe1ece7a2884b.svg" alt="Figure 2-1. Three-way handshake">

        <figcaption>
          <span class="label">Figure 2-1.</span> Three-way handshake
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>Once the three-way handshake is complete, the application data can
      begin to flow between the client and the server. The client can send a
      data packet immediately after the ACK packet, and the server must wait
      for the ACK before it can dispatch any data. This startup process applies
      to every TCP connection and carries an important implication for
      performance of all network applications using TCP: each new connection
      will have a full roundtrip of latency before any application data can be
      transferred.

      </p><p>For example, if our client is in New York, the server is in London,
      and we are starting a new TCP connection over a fiber link, then the
      three-way handshake will take a minimum of 56 milliseconds (<a data-type="xref" href="https://hpbn.co/primer-on-latency-and-bandwidth/#geo-latency-table">Table&nbsp;1-1</a>):
      28 milliseconds to propagate the packet in one direction, after which it
      must return back to New York. Note that bandwidth of the connection plays
      no role here. Instead, the delay is governed by the latency between the
      client and the server, which in turn is dominated by the propagation time
      between New York and London.

      </p><p>The delay imposed by the three-way handshake makes new TCP connections
      expensive to create, and is one of the big reasons why connection reuse
      is a critical optimization for any application running over TCP.

      </p><aside>
        <h4 id="tcp-fast-open"><a href="#tcp-fast-open" class="anchor">§</a>TCP
        Fast Open</h4>

        <p>Loading a webpage often requires fetching hundreds of resources from
        dozens of different hosts. In turn, this might require the browser to
        establish dozens of new TCP connections, each of which will have to
        incur the overhead of the TCP handshake. Needless to say, this can be a
        significant source of web browsing latency, especially on slower mobile
        networks.

        </p><p>TCP Fast Open (TFO) is a mechanism that aims to eliminate the
        latency penalty imposed on new TCP connections by allowing data
        transfer within the SYN packet. However, it does have its own set of
        limitations: there are limits on the maximum size of the data payload
        within the SYN packet, only certain types of HTTP requests can be sent,
        and it works only for repeat connections due to a requirement for a
        cryptographic cookie. For a detailed discussion on the capabilities and
        limitations of TFO, check the latest IETF draft of "TCP Fast Open."

        </p><p>Enabling TFO requires explicit support on the client, server, and
        opt-in from the application. For best results, use the Linux kernel
        v4.1+ on the server, a compatible client (e.g. Linux, or iOS9+ / OSX
        10.11+), and enable the appropriate socket flags within your
        application.

        </p><p>Based on traffic analysis and network emulation done at Google,
        researchers have shown that TFO can decrease HTTP transaction network
        latency by 15%, whole-page load times by over 10% on average, and in
        some cases by up to 40% in high-latency scenarios!

      <h2 id="congestion-avoidance-and-control"><a href="#congestion-avoidance-and-control" class="anchor">§</a>Congestion
      Avoidance and Control</h2>

      <p>In early 1984, John Nagle documented a condition known as "congestion
      collapse," which could affect any network with asymmetric bandwidth
      capacity between the network nodes:

      </p><blockquote>
        <p>Congestion control is a recognized problem in complex networks. We
        have discovered that the Department of Defense’s Internet Protocol
        (IP), a pure datagram protocol, and Transmission Control Protocol
        (TCP), a transport layer protocol, when used together, are subject to
        unusual congestion problems caused by interactions between the
        transport and datagram layers. In particular, IP gateways are
        vulnerable to a phenomenon we call "congestion collapse", especially
        when such gateways connect networks of widely different bandwidth…

        </p><p>Should the roundtrip time exceed the maximum retransmission interval
        for any host, that host will begin to introduce more and more copies of
        the same datagrams into the net. The network is now in serious trouble.
        Eventually all available buffers in the switching nodes will be full
        and packets must be dropped. The roundtrip time for packets that are
        delivered is now at its maximum. Hosts are sending each packet several
        times, and eventually some copy of each packet arrives at its
        destination. This is congestion collapse.

        </p><p>This condition is stable. Once the saturation point has been
        reached, if the algorithm for selecting packets to be dropped is fair,
        the network will continue to operate in a degraded condition.

        </p><p data-type="attribution">John Nagle, <cite>RFC 896</cite>
      </p></blockquote>

      <p>The report concluded that congestion collapse had not yet become a
      problem for ARPANET because most nodes had uniform bandwidth, and the
      backbone had substantial excess capacity. However, neither of these
      assertions held true for long. In 1986, as the number (5,000+) and the
      variety of nodes on the network grew, a series of congestion collapse
      incidents swept throughout the network — in some cases the capacity
      dropped by a factor of 1,000 and the network became unusable.

      </p><p>To address these issues, multiple mechanisms were implemented in TCP
      to govern the rate with which the data can be sent in both directions:
      flow control, congestion control, and congestion avoidance.

      </p><div data-type="note" id="id-wes6HATP">
        <p>Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) was the
        precursor to the modern Internet and the world’s first operational
        packet-switched network. The project was officially launched in 1969,
        and in 1983 the TCP/IP protocols replaced the earlier NCP (Network
        Control Program) as the principal communication protocols. The rest, as
        they say, is history.

        <h3 id="flow-control"><a href="#flow-control" class="anchor">§</a>Flow
        Control</h3>

        <p>Flow control is a mechanism to prevent the sender from overwhelming
        the receiver with data it may not be able to process — the receiver may
        be busy, under heavy load, or may only be willing to allocate a fixed
        amount of buffer space. To address this, each side of the TCP
        connection advertises (<a data-type="xref" href="#rwnd-fig">Figure&nbsp;2-2</a>) its own receive window (rwnd), which
        communicates the size of the available buffer space to hold the
        incoming data.

        </p><p>When the connection is first established, both sides initiate their
        rwnd values by using their system default settings. A typical web page
        will stream the majority of the data from the server to the client,
        making the client’s window the likely bottleneck. However, if a client
        is streaming large amounts of data to the server, such as in the case
        of an image or a video upload, then the server receive window may
        become the limiting factor.

        </p><p>If, for any reason, one of the sides is not able to keep up, then it
        can advertise a smaller window to the sender. If the window reaches
        zero, then it is treated as a signal that no more data should be sent
        until the existing data in the buffer has been cleared by the
        application layer. This workflow continues throughout the lifetime of
        every TCP connection: each ACK packet carries the latest rwnd value for
        each side, allowing both sides to dynamically adjust the data flow rate
        to the capacity and processing speed of the sender and receiver.

          <h4 id="window-scaling-rfc-1323"><a href="#window-scaling-rfc-1323" class="anchor">§</a>Window Scaling (RFC 1323)</h4>

          <p>The original TCP specification allocated 16 bits for advertising
          the receive window size, which places a hard upper bound on the
          maximum value (2<sup>16</sup>, or 65,535 bytes) that can be
          advertised by the sender and receiver. Turns out, this upper bound is
          often not enough to get optimal performance, especially in networks
          that exhibit high bandwidth delay product; more on this can be found
          <a data-type="xref" href="#bandwidth-delay-product" class="select: pagenumber">Bandwidth-Delay Product</a>.

          </p><p>To address this, RFC 1323 was drafted to provide a "TCP window
          scaling" option, which allows us to raise the maximum receive window
          size from 65,535 bytes to 1 gigabyte! The window scaling option is
          communicated during the three-way handshake and carries a value that
          represents the number of bits to left-shift the 16-bit window size
          field in future ACKs.

          </p><p>Today, TCP window scaling is enabled by default on all major
          platforms. However, intermediate nodes, routers, and firewalls can
          rewrite or even strip this option entirely. If your connection to the
          server, or the client, is unable to make full use of the available
          bandwidth, then checking the interaction of your window sizes is
          always a good place to start. On Linux platforms, the window scaling
          setting can be checked and enabled via the following commands:

          </p><ul>
            <li>
              <p><code>$&gt; sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_window_scaling</code>

            </p></li><li>
              <p><code>$&gt; sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_window_scaling=1</code>
          </p></li></ul>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h3 id="slow-start"><a href="#slow-start" class="anchor">§</a>Slow-Start</h3>

        <p>Despite the presence of flow control in TCP, network congestion
        collapse became a real issue in the mid to late 1980s. The problem was
        that flow control prevented the sender from overwhelming the receiver,
        but there was no mechanism to prevent either side from overwhelming the
        underlying network: neither the sender nor the receiver knows the
        available bandwidth at the beginning of a new connection, and hence
        need a mechanism to estimate it and also to adapt their speeds to the
        continuously changing conditions within the network.

        </p><p>To illustrate one example where such an adaptation is beneficial,
        imagine you are at home and streaming a large video from a remote
        server that managed to saturate your downlink to deliver the maximum
        quality experience. Then another user on your home network opens a new
        connection to download some software updates. All of the sudden, the
        amount of available downlink bandwidth to the video stream is much
        less, and the video server must adjust its data rate — otherwise, if it
        continues at the same rate, the data will simply pile up at some
        intermediate gateway and packets will be dropped, leading to
        inefficient use of the network.

        </p><p>In 1988, Van Jacobson and Michael J. Karels documented several
        algorithms to address these problems: slow-start, congestion avoidance,
        fast retransmit, and fast recovery. All four quickly became a mandatory
        part of the TCP specification. In fact, it is widely held that it was
        these updates to TCP that prevented an Internet meltdown in the '80s
        and the early '90s as the traffic continued to grow at an exponential
        rate.

        </p><p>To understand slow-start, it is best to see it in action. So, once
        again, let us come back to our client, who is located in New York,
        attempting to retrieve a file from a server in London. First, the
        three-way handshake is performed, during which both sides advertise
        their respective receive window (rwnd) sizes within the ACK packets
        (<a data-type="xref" href="#rwnd-fig">Figure&nbsp;2-2</a>). Once the
        final ACK packet is put on the wire, we can start exchanging
        application data.

        </p><p>The only way to estimate the available capacity between the client
        and the server is to measure it by exchanging data, and this is
        precisely what slow-start is designed to do. To start, the server
        initializes a new congestion window (cwnd) variable per TCP connection
        and sets its initial value to a conservative, system-specified value
        (initcwnd on Linux).

        </p><dl>
          <dt>Congestion window size (cwnd)

          </dt><dd>
            <p>Sender-side limit on the amount of data the sender can have in
            flight before receiving an acknowledgment (ACK) from the client.
        </p></dd></dl>

        <p>The cwnd variable is not advertised or exchanged between the sender
        and receiver — in this case, it will be a private variable maintained
        by the server in London. Further, a new rule is introduced: the maximum
        amount of data in flight (not ACKed) between the client and the server
        is the minimum of the rwnd and cwnd variables. So far so good, but how
        do the server and the client determine optimal values for their
        congestion window sizes? After all, network conditions vary all the
        time, even between the same two network nodes, as we saw in the earlier
        example, and it would be great if we could use the algorithm without
        having to hand-tune the window sizes for each connection.

        </p><p>The solution is to start slow and to grow the window size as the
        packets are acknowledged: slow-start! Originally, the cwnd start value
        was set to 1 network segment; RFC 2581 updated this value to 4 segments
        in April 1999; most recently the value was increased once more to 10
        segments by RFC 6928 in April 2013.

        </p><p>The maximum amount of data in flight for a new TCP connection is the
        minimum of the rwnd and cwnd values; hence a modern server can send up
        to ten network segments to the client, at which point it must stop and
        wait for an acknowledgment. Then, for every received ACK, the
        slow-start algorithm indicates that the server can increment its cwnd
        window size by one segment — for every ACKed packet, two new packets
        can be sent. This phase of the TCP connection is commonly known as the
        "exponential growth" algorithm (<a data-type="xref" href="#congestion-control-avoidance">Figure&nbsp;2-3</a>), as the client and
        the server are trying to quickly converge on the available bandwidth on
        the network path between them.

        <p>So why is slow-start an important factor to keep in mind when we are
        building applications for the browser? Well, HTTP and many other
        application protocols run over TCP, and no matter the available
        bandwidth, every TCP connection must go through the slow-start phase —
        we cannot use the full capacity of the link immediately!

        </p><p>Instead, we start with a small congestion window and double it for
        every roundtrip — i.e., exponential growth. As a result, the time
        required to reach a specific throughput target is a function
        (<a data-type="xref" href="#ss-time">Time to reach the cwnd size of
        size N</a>) of both the roundtrip time between the client and server
        and the initial congestion window size.

        </p><figure id="ss-time" data-type="equation">
          <h5>Time to reach the cwnd size of size N</h5>
          <img src="bc982fa3a121aff07c20b70f92845668.svg" class="equation">
        </figure>

        <p>For a hands-on example of slow-start impact, let’s assume the
        following scenario:

        </p><ul>
          <li>
            <p>Client and server receive windows: 65,535 bytes (64 KB)

          </p></li><li>
            <p>Initial congestion window: 10 segments (RFC 6928)

          </p></li><li>
            <p>Roundtrip time: 56 ms (London to New York)
        </p></li></ul>

        <p>Despite the 64 KB receive window size, the throughput of a new TCP
        connection is initially limited by the size of the congestion window.
        In fact, to reach the 64 KB receive window limit, we will first need to
        grow the congestion window size to 45 segments, which will take 168
        milliseconds:

        </p><figure data-type="equation" id="id-d4sptvumt6">
          <img src="bbc4446900172ea4b345dc6c79e2932e.svg" class="equation">
        </figure>

        <p>That’s three roundtrips (<a data-type="xref" href="#cwnd-growth">Figure&nbsp;2-4</a>) to reach 64 KB of throughput
        between the client and server! The fact that the client and server may
        be capable of transferring at Mbps+ data rates has no effect when a new
        connection is established — that’s slow-start.

        </p><div data-type="note" id="id-79sRH9U6T9">
          <p>The above example uses the new (RFC 6928) value of ten network
          segments for the initial congestion window. As an exercise, repeat
          the same calculation with the older size of four segments — you’ll
          see that this will add an additional 56 millisecond roundtrip to
          above result!
        </p></div>

        <p>To decrease the amount of time it takes to grow the congestion
        window, we can decrease the roundtrip time between the client and
        server — e.g., move the server geographically closer to the client. Or
        we can increase the initial congestion window size to the new RFC 6928
        value of 10 segments.

        </p><p>Slow-start is not as big of an issue for large, streaming downloads,
        as the client and the server will arrive at their maximum window sizes
        after a few hundred milliseconds and continue to transmit at near
        maximum speeds — the cost of the slow-start phase is amortized over the
        lifetime of the larger transfer.

        </p><p>However, for many HTTP connections, which are often short and
        bursty, it is not unusual for the data transfer to finish before the
        maximum window size is reached. As a result, the performance of many
        web applications is often limited by the roundtrip time between server
        and client: slow-start limits the available bandwidth throughput, which
        has an adverse effect on the performance of small transfers.

          <h4 id="slow-start-restart"><a href="#slow-start-restart" class="anchor">§</a>Slow-Start Restart</h4>

          <p>In addition to regulating the transmission rate of new
          connections, TCP also implements a slow-start restart (SSR)
          mechanism, which resets the congestion window of a connection after
          it has been idle for a defined period of time. The rationale is
          simple: the network conditions may have changed while the connection
          has been idle, and to avoid congestion, the window is reset to a
          "safe" default.

          </p><p>Not surprisingly, SSR can have a significant impact on performance
          of long-lived TCP connections that may idle for bursts of time —
          e.g., due to user inactivity. As a result, it is generally
          recommended to disable SSR on the server to help improve performance
          of long-lived HTTP connections. On Linux platforms, the SSR setting
          can be checked and disabled via the following commands:

          </p><ul>
            <li>
              <p><code>$&gt; sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_slow_start_after_idle</code>

            </p></li><li>
              <p><code>$&gt; sysctl -w
              net.ipv4.tcp_slow_start_after_idle=0</code>
          </p></li></ul>
        </aside>

        <p>To illustrate the impact of the three-way handshake and the
        slow-start phase on a simple HTTP transfer, let’s assume that our
        client in New York requests a 64 KB file from the server in London over
        a new TCP connection (<a data-type="xref" href="#aimd-nyc-london">Figure&nbsp;2-5</a>), and the following connection
        parameters are in place:

      <section>
        <h3 id="congestion-avoidance"><a href="#congestion-avoidance" class="anchor">§</a>Congestion Avoidance</h3>

        <p>It is important to recognize that TCP is specifically designed to
        use packet loss as a feedback mechanism to help regulate its
        performance. In other words, it is not a question of <em>if</em>, but
        rather of <em>when</em> the packet loss will occur. Slow-start
        initializes the connection with a conservative window and, for every
        roundtrip, doubles the amount of data in flight until it exceeds the
        receiver’s flow-control window, a system-configured congestion
        threshold (ssthresh) window, or until a packet is lost, at which point
        the congestion avoidance algorithm (<a data-type="xref" href="#congestion-control-avoidance">Figure&nbsp;2-3</a>) takes over.

        </p><p>The implicit assumption in congestion avoidance is that packet loss
        is indicative of network congestion: somewhere along the path we have
        encountered a congested link or a router, which was forced to drop the
        packet, and hence we need to adjust our window to avoid inducing more
        packet loss to avoid overwhelming the network.

        </p><p>Once the congestion window is reset, congestion avoidance specifies
        its own algorithms for how to grow the window to minimize further loss.
        At a certain point, another packet loss event will occur, and the
        process will repeat once over. If you have ever looked at a throughput
        trace of a TCP connection and observed a sawtooth pattern within it,
        now you know why it looks as such: it is the congestion control and
        avoidance algorithms adjusting the congestion window size to account
        for packet loss in the network.

        </p><p>Finally, it is worth noting that improving congestion control and
        avoidance is an active area both for academic research and commercial
        products: there are adaptations for different network types, different
        types of data transfers, and so on. Today, depending on your platform,
        you will likely run one of the many variants: TCP Tahoe and Reno
        (original implementations), TCP Vegas, TCP New Reno, TCP BIC, TCP CUBIC
        (default on Linux), or Compound TCP (default on Windows), among many
        others. However, regardless of the flavor, the core performance
        implications of congestion control and avoidance hold for all.

        </p><aside>
          <h4 id="proportional-rate-reduction-for-tcp"><a href="#proportional-rate-reduction-for-tcp" class="anchor">§</a>Proportional Rate Reduction for TCP</h4>

          <p>Determining the optimal way to recover from packet loss is a
          nontrivial exercise: if you are too aggressive, then an intermittent
          lost packet will have significant impact on throughput of the entire
          connection, and if you don’t adjust quickly enough, then you will
          induce more packet loss!

          </p><p>Originally, TCP used the Multiplicative Decrease and Additive
          Increase (AIMD) algorithm: when packet loss occurs, halve the
          congestion window size, and then slowly increase the window by a
          fixed amount per roundtrip. However, in many cases AIMD is too
          conservative, and hence new algorithms were developed.

          </p><p>Proportional Rate Reduction (PRR) is a new algorithm specified by
          RFC 6937, whose goal is to improve the speed of recovery when a
          packet is lost. How much better is it? According to measurements done
          at Google, where the new algorithm was developed, it provides a 3–10%
          reduction in average latency for connections with packet loss.

          </p><p>PRR is now the default congestion-avoidance algorithm in Linux
          3.2+ kernels — another good reason to upgrade your servers!

      <h2 id="bandwidth-delay-product"><a href="#bandwidth-delay-product" class="anchor">§</a>Bandwidth-Delay Product</h2>

      <p>The built-in congestion control and congestion avoidance mechanisms in
      TCP carry another important performance implication: the optimal sender
      and receiver window sizes must vary based on the roundtrip time and the
      target data rate between them.

      </p><p>To understand why this is the case, first recall that the maximum
      amount of unacknowledged, in-flight data between the sender and receiver
      is defined as the minimum of the receive (rwnd) and congestion (cwnd)
      window sizes: the current receive windows are communicated in every ACK,
      and the congestion window is dynamically adjusted by the sender based on
      the congestion control and avoidance algorithms.

      </p><p>If either the sender or receiver exceeds the maximum amount of
      unacknowledged data, then it must stop and wait for the other end to ACK
      some of the packets before proceeding. How long would it have to wait?
      That’s dictated by the roundtrip time between the two!

      </p><dl>
        <dt>Bandwidth-delay product (BDP)

        </dt><dd>
          <p>Product of data link’s capacity and its end-to-end delay. The
          result is the maximum amount of unacknowledged data that can be in
          flight at any point in time.
      </p></dd></dl>

      <p>If either the sender or receiver are frequently forced to stop and
      wait for ACKs for previous packets, then this would create gaps in the
      data flow (<a data-type="xref" href="#bdp-gap">Figure&nbsp;2-7</a>),
      which would consequently limit the maximum throughput of the connection.
      To address this problem, the window sizes should be made just big enough,
      such that either side can continue sending data until an ACK arrives back
      from the client for an earlier packet — no gaps, maximum throughput.
      Consequently, the optimal window size depends on the roundtrip time! Pick
      a low window size, and you will limit your connection throughput,
      regardless of the available or advertised bandwidth between the peers.

      </p><figure id="bdp-gap">
        <img src="b08fb4ce2162927bf9b6ce02cdc64ab0.svg" alt="Figure 2-7. Transmission gaps due to low congestion window size">

          congestion window size
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>So how big do the flow control (rwnd) and congestion control (cwnd)
      window values need to be? The actual calculation is a simple one. First,
      let us assume that the minimum of the cwnd and rwnd window sizes is 16
      KB, and the roundtrip time is 100 ms:

      </p><figure data-type="equation" id="id-o7szudcr">
        <img src="2a61d2f4306aa5d7529d1855aabf1d09.svg" class="equation">
      </figure>

      <p>Regardless of the available bandwidth between the sender and receiver,
      this TCP connection will not exceed a 1.31 Mbps data rate! To achieve
      higher throughput we need to raise the window size or lower the roundtrip
      time.

      </p><p>Similarly, we can compute the optimal window size if we know the
      roundtrip time and the available bandwidth on both ends. In this
      scenario, let’s assume that the roundtrip time stays the same (100 ms),
      but the sender has 10 Mbps of available bandwidth, and the receiver is on
      a high-throughput 100 Mbps+ link. Assuming there is no network congestion
      between them, our goal is to saturate the 10 Mbps link available to the
      client:

      </p><figure data-type="equation" id="id-resmcocj">
        <img src="8430e1506bff95cf840315bd1d6d7365.svg" class="equation">
      </figure>

      <p>The window size needs to be at least 122.1 KB to saturate the 10 Mbps
      link. Recall that the maximum receive window size in TCP is 64 KB unless
      window scaling — see <a data-type="xref" href="#window-scaling-rfc-1323">Window Scaling (RFC 1323)</a> — is present:
      double-check your client and server settings!

      </p><p>The good news is that the window size negotiation and tuning is
      managed automatically by the network stack and should adjust accordingly.
      The bad news is sometimes it will still be the limiting factor on TCP
      performance. If you have ever wondered why your connection is
      transmitting at a fraction of the available bandwidth, even when you know
      that both the client and the server are capable of higher rates, then it
      is likely due to a small window size: a saturated peer advertising low
      receive window, bad network weather and high packet loss resetting the
      congestion window, or explicit traffic shaping that could have been
      applied to limit throughput of your connection.

        <p>BDP is a function of the roundtrip time and the target data rate.
        Hence, while the roundtrip time is a common bottleneck in cases with
        high propagation delay, it can also be a bottleneck on a local LAN!

        </p><p>To achieve 1 Gbit/s with 1 ms roundtrip time, we would also need a
        congestion window of at least 122 KB. The calculation is exactly the
        same as we saw earlier; we simply added a few zeroes to the target data
        rate and removed the same amount of zeroes from the roundtrip latency.

      <h2 id="head-of-line-blocking"><a href="#head-of-line-blocking" class="anchor">§</a>Head-of-Line Blocking</h2>

      <p>TCP provides the abstraction of a reliable network running over an
      unreliable channel, which includes basic packet error checking and
      correction, in-order delivery, retransmission of lost packets, as well as
      flow control, congestion control, and congestion avoidance designed to
      operate the network at the point of greatest efficiency. Combined, these
      features make TCP the preferred transport for most applications.

      </p><p>However, while TCP is a popular choice, it is not the only, nor
      necessarily the best choice for every occasion. Specifically, some of the
      features, such as in-order and reliable packet delivery, are not always
      necessary and can introduce unnecessary delays and negative performance
      implications.

      </p><p>To understand why that is the case, recall that every TCP packet
      carries a unique sequence number when put on the wire, and the data must
      be passed to the receiver in-order (<a data-type="xref" href="#tcp-hol-diagram">Figure&nbsp;2-8</a>). If one of the packets is lost en
      route to the receiver, then all subsequent packets must be held in the
      receiver’s TCP buffer until the lost packet is retransmitted and arrives
      at the receiver. Because this work is done within the TCP layer, our
      application has no visibility into the TCP retransmissions or the queued
      packet buffers, and must wait for the full sequence before it is able to
      access the data. Instead, it simply sees a delivery delay when it tries
      to read the data from the socket. This effect is known as TCP
      head-of-line (HOL) blocking.

      </p><p>The delay imposed by head-of-line blocking allows our applications to
      avoid having to deal with packet reordering and reassembly, which makes
      our application code much simpler. However, this is done at the cost of
      introducing unpredictable latency variation in the packet arrival times,
      commonly referred to as <em>jitter</em>, which can negatively impact the
      performance of the application.

      </p><figure id="tcp-hol-diagram">
        <img src="b690c2a309d9c84a92776f6318ec60b8.svg" alt="Figure 2-8. TCP Head-of-line blocking">

          <span class="label">Figure 2-8.</span> TCP Head-of-line blocking
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>Further, some applications may not even need either reliable delivery
      or in-order delivery: if every packet is a standalone message, then
      in-order delivery is strictly unnecessary, and if every message overrides
      all previous messages, then the requirement for reliable delivery can be
      removed entirely. Unfortunately, TCP does not provide such configuration
      — all packets are sequenced and delivered in order.

      </p><p>Applications that can deal with out-of-order delivery or packet loss
      and that are latency or jitter sensitive are likely better served with an
      alternate transport, such as UDP.

      </p><aside>
        <h4 id="packet-loss-is-ok"><a href="#packet-loss-is-ok" class="anchor">§</a>Packet Loss Is OK</h4>

        <p>In fact, packet loss is necessary to get the best performance from
        TCP! A dropped packet acts as a feedback mechanism, which allows the
        receiver and sender to adjust their sending rates to avoid overwhelming
        the network, and to minimize latency; see <a data-type="xref" href="https://hpbn.co/primer-on-latency-and-bandwidth/#bufferbloat-in-your-local-router">Bufferbloat
        in Your Local Router</a>. Further, some applications can tolerate
        packet loss without adverse effects: audio, video, and game state
        updates are common examples of application data that do not require
        either reliable or in-order delivery — incidentally, this is also why
        WebRTC uses UDP as its base transport.

        </p><p>If a packet is lost, then the audio codec can simply insert a minor
        break in the audio and continue processing the incoming packets. If the
        gap is small, the user may not even notice, and waiting for the lost
        packet runs the risk of introducing variable pauses in audio output,
        which would result in a much worse experience for the user.

        </p><p>Similarly, if we are delivering game state updates, then waiting for
        a packet describing its state at time <code>T-1</code>, when we already
        have the packet for time <code>T</code> is often simply unnecessary —
        ideally, we would receive each and every update, but to avoid gameplay
        delays, we can accept intermittent loss in favor of lower latency.

      <h2 id="optimizing-for-tcp"><a href="#optimizing-for-tcp" class="anchor">§</a>Optimizing for TCP</h2>

      <p>TCP is an adaptive protocol designed to be fair to all network peers
      and to make the most efficient use of the underlying network. Thus, the
      best way to optimize TCP is to tune how TCP senses the current network
      conditions and adapts its behavior based on the type and the requirements
      of the layers below and above it: wireless networks may need different
      congestion algorithms, and some applications may need custom quality of
      service (QoS) semantics to deliver the best experience.

      </p><p>The close interplay of the varying application requirements, and the
      many knobs in every TCP algorithm, make TCP tuning and optimization an
      inexhaustible area of academic and commercial research. In this chapter,
      we have only scratched the surface of the many factors that govern TCP
      performance. Additional mechanisms, such as selective acknowledgments
      (SACK), delayed acknowledgments, and fast retransmit, among many others,
      make each TCP session much more complicated (or interesting, depending on
      your perspective) to understand, analyze, and tune.

      </p><p>Having said that, while the specific details of each algorithm and
      feedback mechanism will continue to evolve, the core principles and their
      implications remain unchanged:

      </p><ul>
        <li>
          <p>TCP three-way handshake introduces a full roundtrip of latency.

        </p></li><li>
          <p>TCP slow-start is applied to every new connection.

        </p></li><li>
          <p>TCP flow and congestion control regulate throughput of all
          connections.

        </p></li><li>
          <p>TCP throughput is regulated by current congestion window size.
      </p></li></ul>

      <p>As a result, the rate with which a TCP connection can transfer data in
      modern high-speed networks is often limited by the roundtrip time between
      the receiver and sender. Further, while bandwidth continues to increase,
      latency is bounded by the speed of light and is already within a small
      constant factor of its maximum value. In most cases, latency, not
      bandwidth, is the bottleneck for TCP — e.g., see <a data-type="xref" href="#aimd-nyc-london">Figure&nbsp;2-5</a>.

        <h3 id="tuning-server-configuration"><a href="#tuning-server-configuration" class="anchor">§</a>Tuning Server
        Configuration</h3>

        <p>As a starting point, prior to tuning any specific values for each
        buffer and timeout variable in TCP, of which there are dozens, you are
        much better off simply upgrading your hosts to their latest system
        versions. TCP best practices and underlying algorithms that govern its
        performance continue to evolve, and most of these changes are available
        only in the latest kernels. In short, keep your servers up to date to
        ensure the optimal interaction between the sender’s and receiver’s TCP
        stacks.

        </p><div data-type="note" id="id-mDs4f5SNiD">
          <p>On the surface, upgrading server kernel versions seems like
          trivial advice. However, in practice, it is often met with
          significant resistance: many existing servers are tuned for specific
          kernel versions, and system administrators are reluctant to perform
          the upgrade.

          </p><p>To be fair, every upgrade brings its risks, but to get the best
          TCP performance, it is also likely the single best investment you can
          make.
        </p></div>

        <p>With the latest kernel in place, it is good practice to ensure that
        your server is configured to use the following best practices:

        <p>The combination of the preceding settings and the latest kernel will

        individual TCP connections.

        </p><p>Depending on your application, you may also need to tune other TCP
        settings on the server to optimize for high connection rates, memory
        consumption, or similar criteria. Consult your platform documentation
        and read through <a href="https://hpbn.co/http-tcp">"TCP Tuning for

        Behavior</h3>

        <p>Tuning performance of TCP allows the server and client to deliver
        the best throughput and latency for an individual connection. However,
        how an application uses each new, or established, TCP connection can
        have an even greater impact:

        </p><ul>
          <li>
            <p>No bit is faster than one that is not sent; send fewer bits.

          </p></li><li>
            <p>We can’t make the bits travel faster, but we can move the bits
            closer.

          </p></li><li>
            <p>TCP connection reuse is critical to improve performance.
        </p></li></ul>

        <p>Eliminating unnecessary data transfers is, of course, the single
        best optimization — e.g., eliminating unnecessary resources or ensuring
        that the minimum number of bits is transferred by applying the
        appropriate compression algorithm. Following that, locating the bits
        closer to the client, by geo-distributing servers around the world —
        e.g., using a CDN — will help reduce latency of network roundtrips and
        significantly improve TCP performance. Finally, where possible,
        existing TCP connections should be reused to minimize overhead imposed
        by slow-start and other congestion mechanisms.
