  </p></header>

  <article data-type="chapter" id="SERVER_SENT_EVENTS">
    <section id="introduction">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>Server-Sent Events enables efficient server-to-client streaming of
      text-based event data—e.g., real-time notifications or updates generated
      on the server. To meet this goal, SSE introduces two components: a new
      EventSource interface in the browser, which allows the client to receive
      push notifications from the server as DOM events, and the "event stream"
      data format, which is used to deliver the individual updates.

      </p><p>The combination of the EventSource API in the browser and the
      well-defined event stream data format is what makes SSE both an efficient
      and an indispensable tool for handling real-time data in the browser:

      </p><ul>
        <li>
          <p>Low latency delivery via a single, long-lived connection

        </p></li><li>
          <p>Efficient browser message parsing with no unbounded buffers

        </p></li><li>
          <p>Automatic tracking of last seen message and auto reconnect

        </p></li><li>
          <p>Client message notifications as DOM events
      </p></li></ul>

      <p>Under the hood, SSE provides an efficient, cross-browser
      implementation of XHR streaming; the actual delivery of the messages is
      done over a single, long-lived HTTP connection. However, unlike dealing
      XHR streaming on our own, the browser handles all the connection
      management and message parsing, allowing our applications to focus on the
      business logic! In short, SSE makes working with real-time data simple
      and efficient. Let’s take a look under the hood.
    </p></section>

      <h2 id="eventsource-api"><a href="#eventsource-api" class="anchor">§</a>EventSource API</h2>

      <p>The EventSource interface abstracts all the low-level connection
      establishment and message parsing behind a simple browser API. To get
      started, we simply need to specify the URL of the SSE event stream
      resource and register the appropriate JavaScript event listeners on the
      object:

      </p><div data-type="example" id="-2eC1HVSX">
        <pre data-type="programlisting">var source = new EventSource("/path/to/stream-url"); <a class="counter" id="es-co" href="#es"></a>

source.onopen = function () { ... }; <a class="counter" id="esopen-co" href="#esopen"></a>
source.onerror = function () { ... }; <a class="counter" id="eserror-co" href="#eserror"></a>

source.addEventListener("foo", function (event) { <a class="counter" id="esfoo-co" href="#esfoo"></a>
  processFoo(event.data);
});

source.onmessage = function (event) {  <a class="counter" id="esm-co" href="#esm"></a>
  log_message(event.id, event.data);

  if (event.id == "CLOSE") {
    source.close(); <a class="counter" id="esclose-co" href="#esclose"></a>
  }
}
</pre>

        <ol class="notation">
          <li>
            <a class="co" id="es" href="#es-co"></a>

            <p>Open new SSE connection to stream endpoint

          </p></li><li>
            <a class="co" id="esopen" href="#esopen-co"></a>

            <p>Optional callback, invoked when connection is established

          </p></li><li>
            <a class="co" id="eserror" href="#eserror-co"></a>

            <p>Optional callback, invoked if the connection fails

          </p></li><li>
            <a class="co" id="esfoo" href="#esfoo-co"></a>

            <p>Subscribe to event of type "foo"; invoke custom logic

          </p></li><li>
            <a class="co" id="esm" href="#esm-co"></a>

            <p>Subscribe to all events without an explicit type

          </p></li><li>
            <a class="co" id="esclose" href="#esclose-co"></a>

            <p>Close SSE connection if server sends a "CLOSE" message ID
        </p></li></ol>
      </div>

      <div data-type="note" id="id-roCVIXSk">
        <p>EventSource can stream event data from remote origins by leveraging
        the same CORS permission and opt-in workflow as a regular XHR.
      </p></div>

      <p>That’s all there is to it for the client API. The implementation logic
      is handled for us: the connection is negotiated on our behalf, received
      data is parsed incrementally, message boundaries are identified, and
      finally a DOM event is fired by the browser. EventSource interface allows
      the application to focus on the business logic: open new connection,
      process received event notifications, terminate stream when finished.

      </p><div data-type="note" id="id-0MCeSWSk">
        <p>SSE provides a memory-efficient implementation of XHR streaming.
        Unlike a raw XHR connection, which buffers the full received response
        until the connection is dropped, an SSE connection can discard
        processed messages without accumulating all of them in memory.
      </p></div>

      <p>As icing on the cake, the EventSource interface also provides
      auto-reconnect and tracking of the last seen message: if the connection
      is dropped, EventSource will automatically reconnect to the server and
      optionally advertise the ID of the last seen message, such that the
      stream can be resumed and lost messages can be retransmitted.

      </p><p>How does the browser know the ID, type, and boundary of each message?
      This is where the event stream protocol comes in. The combination of a
      simple client API and a well-defined data format is what allows us to
      offload the bulk of the work to the browser. The two go hand in hand,
      even though the low-level data protocol is completely transparent to the
      application in the browser.

      </p><aside>
        <h4 id="emulating-eventsource-with-custom-javascript"><a href="#emulating-eventsource-with-custom-javascript" class="anchor">§</a>Emulating EventSource with Custom JavaScript</h4>

        <p>SSE was an early addition to the HTML5 specification and is natively
        supported by most modern browsers. The two notable omissions, as of
        early 2013, are Internet Explorer and the stock Android browser. For
        the latest status, see <a href="http://caniuse.com/eventsource">caniuse.com/eventsource</a>.

        </p><p>However, the good news is the EventSource interface is simple enough
        such that it can be emulated via an optional JavaScript library (i.e.,
        a "polyfill") for browsers that do not support it natively. Similarly,
        the delivery of the event stream can be implemented on top of existing
        XHR mechanisms:

        </p><pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="javascript" data-highlighted="true"><code class="k">if</code> <code class="p">(</code><code class="o">!</code><code class="nb">window</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">EventSource</code><code class="p">)</code> <code class="p">{</code>
  <code class="c1">// load JavaScript polyfill library</code>
<code class="p">}</code>

<code class="kd">var</code> <code class="nx">source</code> <code class="o">=</code> <code class="k">new</code> <code class="nx">EventSource</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="s2">"/event-stream-endpoint"</code><code class="p">);</code>
<code class="p">...</code></pre>

        <p>The benefit of using a polyfill library is that it allows our
        applications to, once again, focus on the application logic, instead of
        worrying about the browser quirks and implementation status. Having
        said that, while a polyfill will provide a consistent API, be aware
        that the underlying XHR transport will not be as efficient:

        </p><ul>
          <li>
            <p>XHR polling will incur message delays and high request overhead.

          </p></li><li>
            <p>XHR long-polling minimizes latency delays but has high request
            overhead.

          </p></li><li>
            <p>XHR streaming support is limited and buffers all the data in
            memory.
        </p></li></ul>

        <p>Without native support for efficient XHR streaming of event stream
        data, the polyfill library can fallback to polling, long-polling, or
        XHR streaming, each of which has its own performance costs. For a full
        discussion, refer to <a data-type="xref" href="https://hpbn.co/xmlhttprequest/#real-time-notifications-and-delivery">Real-Time
        Notifications and Delivery</a>.

        </p><p>In short, check the implementation of your polyfill library to
        ensure that it meets your performance goals! Many of the most popular
        libraries (e.g., jQuery.EventSource) use XHR polling to emulate the SSE
        transport—simple, but also an inefficient transport.

      <h2 id="event-stream-protocol"><a href="#event-stream-protocol" class="anchor">§</a>Event Stream Protocol</h2>

      <p>An SSE event stream is delivered as a streaming HTTP response: the
      client initiates a regular HTTP request, the server responds with a
      custom <em>"text/event-stream"</em> content-type, and then streams the
      UTF-8 encoded event data. However, even that sounds too complicated, so
      an example is in order:

      </p><div data-type="example" id="-roCpHysk">
        <pre data-type="programlisting">=&gt; Request
GET /stream HTTP/1.1 <a class="counter" id="esreq-co" href="#esreq"></a>

</pre>

        <ol class="notation">

            <a class="co" id="esreq" href="#esreq-co"></a>

            <p>Server sets client reconnect interval (15s) if the connection
            drops

          </p></li><li>

            <p>Simple text event with no message type

          </p></li><li>

            <p>Simple text event of type "foo"

          </p></li><li>
            <a class="co" id="esid" href="#esid-co"></a>

            <p>Multiline event with message ID and type

          </p></li><li>
            <a class="co" id="esid2" href="#esid2-co"></a>

            <p>Simple text event with optional ID
        </p></li></ol>
      </div>

      <p>The event-stream protocol is trivial to understand and implement:

      </p><ul>
        <li>
          <p>Event payload is the value of one or more adjacent
          <code>data</code> fields.

        </p></li><li>
          <p>Event may carry an optional <code>ID</code> and an
          <code>event</code> type string.

        </p></li><li>
          <p>Event boundaries are marked by newlines.
      </p></li></ul>

      <p>On the receiving end, the EventSource interface parses the incoming
      stream by looking for newline separators, extracts the payload from data
      fields, checks for optional ID and type, and finally dispatches a DOM
      event to notify the application. If a type is present, then a custom DOM
      event is fired, and otherwise the generic "onmessage" callback is
      invoked; see <a data-type="xref" href="#eventsource-api">EventSource
      API</a> for both cases.

      </p><aside>
        <h4 id="utf-8-encoding-and-binary-transfers-with-sse"><a href="#utf-8-encoding-and-binary-transfers-with-sse" class="anchor">§</a>UTF-8 Encoding and Binary Transfers with SSE</h4>

        <p>EventSource does not perform any additional processing on the actual
        payload: the message is extracted from one or more data fields,
        concatenated together and passed directly to the application. As such,
        the server can push any text-based format (e.g., a simple string, JSON
        payload, etc.), and the application must decode it on its own.

        </p><p>Having said that, note that all event source data is UTF-8 encoded:
        SSE is not meant as a mechanism for transferring binary payloads! If
        necessary, one could base64 encode an arbitrary binary object to make
        it SSE friendly, but doing so would incur high (33%) byte overhead; see
        <a data-type="xref" href="https://hpbn.co/http1x/#resource-inlining">Resource
        Inlining</a>.

        </p><p>Concerned by high overhead of UTF-8 on the wire? An SSE connection
        is a streaming HTTP response, which means that it can be compressed
        (i.e., gziped), just as any other HTTP response while in flight! While
        SSE is not meant for delivery of binary data, it is nonetheless an
        efficient transport: ensure that your server is applying gzip
        compression on the SSE stream.

        </p><p>Lack of support for binary streaming is not an oversight. SSE was
        specifically designed as a simple, efficient, server-to-client
        transport for text-based data. If you need to transfer binary payloads,
        then a WebSocket is the right tool for the job.
      </p></aside>

      <p>Finally, in addition to automatic event parsing, SSE provides built-in
      support for reestablishing dropped connections, as well as recovery of
      messages the client may have missed while disconnected. By default, if
      the connection is dropped, then the browser will automatically
      reestablish the connection. The SSE specification recommends a 2–3 second
      delay, which is a common default for most browsers, but the server can
      also set a custom interval at any point by sending a <code>retry</code>
      command to the client.

      </p><p>Similarly, the server can also associate an arbitrary ID string with
      each message. The browser automatically remembers the last seen ID and
      will automatically append a "Last-Event-ID" HTTP header with the
      remembered value when issuing a reconnect request. Here’s an example:

      </p><div data-type="example" id="-eqC8CpsB">
        <pre data-type="programlisting">(existing SSE connection)
retry: 4500 <a class="counter" id="es1sretry-co" href="#es1sretry"></a>

id: 43 <a class="counter" id="esid43-co" href="#esid43"></a>
data: Lorem ipsum

(connection dropped)
(4500 ms later)

=&gt; Request
GET /stream HTTP/1.1 <a class="counter" id="esreqr-co" href="#esreqr"></a>

</pre>

        <ol class="notation">
          <li>
            <a class="co" id="es1sretry" href="#es1sretry-co"></a>

            <p>Server sets the client reconnect interval to 4.5 seconds

          </p></li><li>
            <a class="co" id="esid43" href="#esid43-co"></a>

            <p>Simple text event, ID: 43

          </p></li><li>
            <a class="co" id="esreqr" href="#esreqr-co"></a>

            <p>Automatic client reconnect request with last seen event ID

          </p></li><li>
            <a class="co" id="esrespr" href="#esrespr-co"></a>

            <p>Server response with "text/event-stream" content-type

          </p></li><li>
            <a class="co" id="esid44" href="#esid44-co"></a>

            <p>Simple text event, ID: 44
        </p></li></ol>
      </div>

      <p>The client application does not need to provide any extra logic to
      reestablish the connection or remember the last seen event ID. The entire
      workflow is handled by the browser, and we rely on the server to handle
      the recovery. Specifically, depending on the requirements of the
      application and the data stream, the server can implement several
      different strategies:

      </p><ul>
        <li>
          <p>If lost messages are acceptable, then no event IDs or special
          logic is required: simply let the client reconnect and resume the
          stream.

        </p></li><li>
          <p>If message recovery is required, then the server needs to specify
          IDs for relevant events, such that the client can report the last
          seen ID when reconnecting. Also, the server needs to implement some
          form of a local cache to recover and retransmit missed messages to
          the client.
      </p></li></ul>

      <p>The exact implementation details of how far back the messages are
      persisted are, of course, specific to the requirements of the
      application. Further, note that the ID is an optional event stream field.
      Hence, the server can also choose to checkpoint specific messages or
      milestones in the delivered event stream. In short, evaluate your
      requirements, and implement the appropriate logic on the server.

      text-based real-time data: messages can be pushed the moment they become
      available on the server (low latency), there is minimum message overhead
      (long-lived connection, event-stream protocol, and gzip compression), the
      browser handles all the message parsing, and there are no unbounded
      buffers. Add to that a convenient EventSource API with auto-reconnect and
      message notifications as DOM events, and SSE becomes an indispensable
      tool for working with real-time data!

      </p><p>There are two key limitations to SSE. First, it is server-to-client
      only and hence does not address the request streaming use case—e.g.,
      streaming a large upload to the server. Second, the event-stream protocol
      is specifically designed to transfer UTF-8 data: binary streaming, while
      possible, is inefficient.

      </p><p>Having said that, the UTF-8 limitation can often be resolved at the
      application layer: SSE delivers a notification to the application about a
      new binary asset available on the server, and the application dispatches
      an XHR request to fetch it. While this incurs an extra roundtrip of
      latency, it also has the benefit of leveraging the numerous services
      provided by the XHR: response caching, transfer-encoding (compression),
      and so on. If an asset is streamed, it cannot be cached by the browser
      cache.

        <p>Real-time push, just as polling, can have a large negative impact on
        battery life. First, consider batching messages to avoid waking up the
        radio. Second, eliminate unnecessary keepalives; an SSE connection is
        not "dropped" while the radio is idle. For more details, see

        <p>SSE provides a simple and convenient real-time transport on top of a
        regular HTTP connection, which makes it simple to deploy on the server
        and to polyfill on the client. However, existing network middleware,
        such as proxy servers and firewalls, which are not SSE aware, may still
        cause problems: intermediaries may choose to buffer the event-stream
        data, which will translate to increased latency or an outright broken
        SSE connection.

        </p><p>As a result, if you experience this or similar problems, you may
        want to consider delivering an SSE event-stream over a TLS connection;
